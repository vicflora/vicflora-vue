## Introduction

The multi-access key to the Asteraceae of Victoria is a key to Victoria’s largest plant family and contains all 618 Asteraceae (daisy) taxa that are known to occur in Victoria, both native and introduced. It contains 49 characters to help distinguish taxa from each other with, including place of occurrence, stature and growth form, and several morphological features both vegetative and reproductive. It differs from the other (dichotomous) keys provided in VicFlora by giving the user the flexibility to choose from one of the 49 characters provided rather than the user having to commit to investigate the particular features being questioned in the dichotomous keys. This has the benefit of:

1.  avoiding having to answer questions relating to a feature that may not be present in the sample when being identified,

2.  potentially being able to identify a taxon without needing to comprehend the most technical terminology and

3.  allowing the rapid identification of taxa with distinct features rarely encountered in the family

To use the key the user selects a feature from the features in the top left Features Available panel and clicks on the state present in their specimen to be identified. Once selected this feature and state will show as being selected in the Features Chosen panel directly below the Features Available panel. To undo a selection, click on the box next to the state chosen in the Features Chosen panel to erase the tick in the box. Once a feature state is chosen all the taxa that do not possess the chosen feature state are discarded in the bottom right Entities Discarded panel and those that do possess the chosen are retained in the top right Entities Remaining panel. The user continues to choose further character states present in their specimen until identification is acheived. To restart the key when finished select the restart key icon represented by the two green arrows in the top left corner of the screen.

## General helpful hints

For the most effective use of this key the user is encouraged to read the help guides for each character and state before submitting an answer for that character and state. Help guides and photographs can be found by clicking on the page icons beside characters and states. This help will reduce the chance of misinterpretation of the character and state. Some information and definitions required for interpreting a state may be given under character so users are encouraged to read the help guide for the characters before the states. When taking measurements or assessing which state a character exists in for the taxon being identified a typical plant and plant part should be used. Typical is here interpreted as a close representation of the average plant in terms of size and stature in a population and a plant part that represents the average condition for that character (e.g. average length, the most frequently observed density of hairs etc.). The plant chosen should also be reproductively mature because states and measurements refer to plants at maturity. For some of the characters it is possible for some taxa to possess more than one character state for the character. In such cases either correct character state can be chosen. When taking measurements be precise e.g. if a cypsela is 4.9 mm long enter 4.9 mm long rather than rounding up to 5 mm and entering that.

To help identify the specimen to be identified as quickly as possible the best option can be used. This option highlights which charaters should be used first to discard the maximum number of taxa among the remaining taxa. To use the best option select the best icon given as a blue wand at the top of the screen. For some similar taxa such as closely related species or subspecies within a species it may become time consuming to keep using the key until one taxon remains. In such instances the user can use the dichotomous keys and profiles to help to distinguish between similar species.

## Occurrence

### Natural Region

Victoria has been divided into 16 natural regions. For this character the user determines which natural region the plant that is to be identified was found in to enter for this character. Whether a taxon is regarded as occurring in a particular natural region or not is dependent on whether the taxon has been previously documented as occurring in that natural region or not. There is a remote possible that a taxon occurs in a natural region but has not yet been documented in that natural region. In such a case the key will not recognise that taxon as occurring in that natural region which will result in a misidentification for the user. This issue may be particularly relevant to newly introduced species which may be still expanding their range through Victoria or for taxa that are undercollected for herbaria. Due to these issues it is suggested that this character be one of the first characters investigated as a potential reason for misidentification.

## Plant

This group of four characters refer to the plant in its entirety.

### Height

This is a measurement in centimeters (cm) from the base of the plant at ground level to the highest point on the plant. If the plant is a herb with most of its height contributed by the reproductive parts (inflorescence and infructescence) then the measurement includes these reproductive parts.

### Habit

This is the general growth form of the plant and includes four states.

* #### Herb

  This state refers to plants that lack woody stems. Plants that are small in stature when reproductive generally fall into this category, however, some herbs can become large but still do not produce woody stems and branches.

* #### Shrub

  This state refers to plants that have woody stems and branches. Small shrubs often referred to as subshrubs are included in this state.

* #### Tree

  This state refers to plants that have woody single stems and woody branches but are larger than shrubs (typically over 3 metres tall) and includes two species in the Asteraceae of Victoria: *Bedfordia arborescens* and *Olearia argophylla*, both small understorey trees of wet forests.

* #### Vine

  This state refers to plants that trail or climb over other vegetation which helps to support the vine and includes two introduced species in the Asteraceae of Victoria: *Delairea odorata* and *Senecio angulatus*. Both species have been recorded in the southern parts of the state.

### Duration

This character refers to how long the plant lives for and includes two states.

* #### Annual

  This state refers to plants that live for only one year and then die.

* #### Perennial

  This state refers to plants that live for more than one year. Biennials live for more than one year and consequently are included within this state.

### Sexuality

This characters refers to whether a single plant bears both fertile female and male reproductive organs or not and includes two states.

* #### Monoecious

  This state refers to plants that bear both fertile female and male reproductive organs on the same plant. This can include plants that bear flowers (florets) with both fertile stamens and style, plants that bear flower heads (capitula) with both unisexual and bisexual florets and plants that bear separate female and male capitula.

* #### Dioecious

  This state refers to plants that don’t bear female and male reproductive organs on the same plant.

## Stem or scape

This group of four characters refer to the main axis (stem) of the plant and includes the stalk (peduncle) leading to the flower head (capitulum) if the plant is a rosetted herb without a distinct aerial main stem.

### Stem form

This character describes the growth form of the main axis of the plant and includes two states.

* #### Rhizomatous or stoloniferous

  This state refers to stems that creep above or under the ground and produce roots at nodes, at intervals, or along the entire length of the stem.

* #### Neither rhizomatous nor stoloniferous

  This state refers to stems that are generally erect but if they are positioned near the ground or are creeping do not produce roots at any point along the creeping stem.

### Stem indument

This character refers to the presence of hairs on the stem or scape and includes three states.

* #### Stem glabrous

  This state refers to plants that have stems or scapes completely devoid of any type of hairs.

* #### Stem with eglandular hairs

  This state refers to plants that have stems or scapes that have hairs that do not end in a gland (i.e. glandular hair) which usually appear as a spherical structure or drastic broadening near the hair tip. Several taxa bear both eglandular hairs and glandular hairs. For such taxa either character state may be chosen.

* #### Stem with glandular hairs

  This state refers to plants that have stems or scapes that have hairs that end in a gland. Glands usually appear as a spherical structure or drastic broadening near the hair tip. Some taxa may have glandular surfaces but these glands lack a stalk (are sessile on the surface) and are here not considered hairs. Several taxa bear both glandular and eglandular hairs. For such taxa either character state may be chosen.

### Stem spines

This characters refers to the presence of hard rigid spines on a stem. Such spines are generally sharp and painful to touch. This character includes two states.

* #### Stem spines present

  The stem bears hard rigid spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch.

* #### Stem spines absent

  The stem does not bear hard rigid spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch.

### Stem wings

This character refers to the presence of leaf-like extensions that follow along a stem and includes two states.

* #### Stem wings absent

  The stem does not bear leaf-like extensions.

* #### Stem wings present

  The stem bears leaf-like extensions.

## Leaf

This group of nine characters refers to the main photosynthetic and green organ (leaf) of the plant.

### Leaf Length

This character requires the user to measure and enter the distance in millimetres (mm) from the point of attachment to a stem to the apex or end of the leaf. For taxa that have a distinct leaf stalk or petiole this measurement includes the petiole as well as the expanded blade or lamina section. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

### Leaf width

This character requires the user to measure and enter the distance in millimetres (mm) across the widest part of the leaf. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

### Outline shape

This character refers to shape of the leaf for simple leaves or the shape that would be created if a smooth line was drawn to connect the tips of all the divisions of a divided leaf. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant. This character comprises three states.

* #### Widest near the base

  This state refers to leaves where the widest point lies between where the leaf is attached to the stem and half way to the tip (apex) of the leaf. It includes the shapes ovate, lanceolate, hastate and triangular. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Widest near middle or similar width near base and apex

  This state refers to leaves where the widest point lies around half way between a the attachment point of a leaf to the stem and the tip (apex) of the leaf or leaves that have a similar width near the base, middle and apex. It includes the shapes linear, oblong, elliptic, rhombic and orbicular. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Widest near apex

  This state refers to leaves where the widest point lies between the tip (apex) of the leaf and half way to its attachment point with the stem. It includes the shapes oblanceolate, spathulate, cuneate, obcordate and obovate. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

### Dissection

This character refers to the degree that the leaf is dissected into segments or lobes and includes five states. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Entire

  This state refers to leaves where the edge (margin) is completely intact and without incisions or teeth. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Denticulate, serrulate or crenulate

  This state refers to leaves where the edge (margin) has small sharp or rounded teeth that are incised less than a tenth of the way to the midrib of the leaf. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Crenate, serrate or dentate

  This state refers to leaves where the edge (margin) has sharp or rounded teeth that are incised around a tenth to a half of the way to the midrib. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Lobed, pinnate or pinnatisect

  This state refers to leaves that have segments that are formed by an incision of at least a half of the way to the midrib. Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

* #### Bipinnate or more dissected

  This state refers to leaves that have segments that are incised into lobes or pinnae (see Lobed, pinnate or pinnatisect for further definitions). Avoid selecting leaves close to inflorescences and flower heads (capitula) or smaller leaves sprouting from the junction (axil) of larger leaves and the stem as these leaves are often not a good representative of the typical size and shape of the leaves of the plant.

### Arrangement

This character refers to how leaves are arranged on the plant and includes three states.

* #### Alternate and cauline

  This state refers to when leaves are borne singly at different levels along a stem. In some taxa a cluster of leaves can appear in the angle (axil) formed by a leaf and the stem bearing it giving the impression that the leaf is not borne singly. However, these clusters of leaves are formed by precocious growth of the axillary bud of a single leaf and consequently such taxa would be included within this state. The clusters of leaves will exhibit an alternate pattern.

* #### Opposite and cauline

  This state refers to when two leaves are borne at the same level on the stem but on opposite sides of the stem.

* #### Basal rosette

  This state refers to plants which lack a main stem and have all their leaves clustered together at ground level.

### Orientation

This characters refers to whether the leaves are pressed up against the stem or not and includes two states.

* #### Appressed to the stem

  This state refers to leaves that are pressed against the stem so that only one surface of the leaf is visible.

* #### Not appressed to the stem

  This state refers to leaves that are not pressed against the stem so that all surfaces of the leaf are visible.

### Adaxial indument

This character refers to the density of hairs on the upper side of the leaf and includes four states.

* #### Adaxial surface glabrous or glabrescent

  This state refers to if the upper side of the leaf is completely devoid of any type of hairs or if the leaf has the occasional hair.

* #### Adaxial surface moderately hairy all over lamina

  This state refers to if the upper side of the leaf possesses hairs all over the flattened part of the leaf (lamina) so that they are instantly spotted at least with some visual aid such as a hand lens or microscope.

* #### Adaxial surface densely hairy obscuring leaf surface of influencing the leaf colour

  This state refers to if the upper side of the leaf possesses a dense covering of hairs such that they can usually be discerned without visual aids such as a hand lens or microscope and either obscures the leaf surface or at least makes the leaf appear the colour of the hair rather than the green of the leaf surface.

* #### Adaxial surface hairy on margin only

  This state refers to if the leaf has hairs confined completely to the edge (margin).

### Abaxial indument

This character refers to the density of hairs on the lower side of the leaf and includes four states.

* #### Abaxial surface glabrous or glabrescent

  This state refers to if the lower side of the leaf is completely devoid of any type of hairs or if the leaf has the occasional hair.

* #### Abaxial surface moderately hairy all over lamina

  This state refers to if the lower side of the leaf possesses hairs all over the flattened part of the leaf (lamina) so that they are instantly spotted at least with some visual aid such as a hand lens or microscope.

* #### Abaxial surface densely hairy obscuring leaf surface or influencing the leaf colour

  This state refers to if the lower side of the leaf possesses a dense covering of hairs such that they can usually be discerned without visual aids such as a hand lens or microscope and either obscures the leaf surface or at least makes the leaf appear the colour of the hair rather than the green of the leaf surface.

* #### Abaxial surface hairy on margin only

  This state refers to if the leaf has hairs confined completely to the edge (margin).

### Leaf spines

This characters refers to the presence of hard rigid spines on the leaves. Such spines are generally sharp and painful to touch. This character includes two states.

* #### Leaf spines present

  The leaves bear hard rigid spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch.

* #### Leaf spines absent

  The leaves do not bear hard rigid spines that are generally sharp and painful to touch.

## Capitulum

In Asteraceae individual flowers (florets) are generally small (usually less than 5 mm diameter and 40 mm long) and are almost always tightly clustered together into a flower head called a capitulum (pl. capitula). The capitulum is what masquerades as the “daisy flower”, particularly in daisies that have florets on the edge of the capitulum that are morphologically distinct from the central florets and superficially resemble “petals”. This group of ten characters relate to the capitulum.

### Capitulum arrangement

This character refers to whether the capitula are borne singly or together and includes two states.

* #### Solitary

  This state refers to if capitula are always borne singly without other capitula borne on the same stem nearby.

* #### In a conflorescence

  This state refers to if capitula are borne together so that a cluster of capitula occur on the one stem. In some taxa the capitula are separated by a few leaves but multiple capitula appear clustered nearby on the same main stem. Such taxa are included within this state.

### Type

This character refers to whether what appears to be a capitulum is actually more than one capitulum aggregated closely together and sharing a common set of bracts or not. This character includes two states.

* #### Compound head

  This state applies to taxa that have more than one capitulum aggregated closely together and sharing a common set of bracts (compound head). This compound head superficially resembles a simple capitulum. The bracts of each individual capitulum are usually retained within the compound head and if found can help to reveal the identity of the compound head. These bracts may be confused with receptacle scales or paleae but capitular bracts in a compound head usually exhibit more differentiation of parts (e.g. a green base and clear edge and lamina).

* #### Simple capitulum

  This state applies to taxa that do not produce compound heads (see definition in compound head).

### Position

This character refers to the place on the stem that the capitula are borne and includes two states.

* #### Terminal

  This state refers to capitula that are borne on the ends of stems or axes. This may include at the end of short lateral branches.

* #### Axillary

  This state refers to capitula that are borne in the angle formed by the leaf and the branch bearing it (axil).

### Attachment

This character refers to whether the capitulum is stalked or is attached directly to the stem without a stalk and includes two states.

* #### Sessile

  This state refers to capitula that are attached directly to the stem without a clearly discernible stalk (peduncle).

* #### Pedunculate

  This state refers to capitula that are attached by a stalk (peduncle) to the stem.

### Floret types present

This character deals with the types of flowers (florets) that make up the capitulum and includes three states.

* #### Only ligulate florets present

  This state refers to capitula that are entirely composed of flowers (florets) that have all the petals forming a strap (ligule) to one side of the floret with 5 teeth at the end of the ligule (ligulate floret). As a result all florets in such a capitulum are zygomorphic (symmetric about one vertical plane only). This type of capitulum is referred to as a ligulifloral capitulum and is unique to the group of daisies that include dandelions (Tribe Lactuceae). The florets towards the centre of a ligulifloral head usually have their ligules less expanded than those towards the outside of the capitulum and can give the initially impression of actinomorphic disc florets (see only tubular or disc florets present character for definition). Close inspection should easily reveal the zygomorphic nature of these florets. Floret colour other than yellow is rare for this state.

* #### Only tubular or disc florets present

  This state refers to capitula that are entirely composed of flowers (florets) that have all the petals fused into a tube and forming triangular teeth that are spread about evenly around the top of the tube (tubular or disc florets). As a result all florets in such a capitulum are actinomorphic (able to be bisected into similar halves in at least two planes). Discoid and disciform capitula belong to this state. In some taxa (everlastings, paper daisies) the involucral bracts are colourful and spreading and resemble a different type of floret (also see both inner tubular or disc florets and outer ray florets). These taxa usually have capitula with only tubular or disc florets.

* #### Both inner tubular or disc florets and outer ray florets

  This state refers to capitula that have tubular or disc florets (see only tubular or disc florets present) in the center of the capitulum and to the outside of these florets are florets that have all the petals forming a strap (ligule) to one side of the floret with 3 or 4 teeth at the end of the ligule (ray floret).

### Sexuality

This character refers to whether a capitulum has both fertile stamens and styles or not and contains two states.

* #### Unisexual

  This state refers to capitula that only have fertile stamens with the ovaries aborting and not forming fertile seed or capitula that have no fertile stamens.

* #### Bisexual

  This state refers to capitula that have both fertile stamens and ovaries present. Often unisexual florets will be present but in such cases other florets in the same capitulum will have fertile organs of the opposite sex present.

### Sexual composition

This character is concerned with the sex of the florets within a capitulum and contains thirteen states.

* #### All florets bisexual

  In this state every floret with a capitulum is bisexual, so both fertile stamens and ovaries will be present in every floret.

* #### Inner disc florets bisexual and outer disc florets female

  In this state the florets towards the outer edge of the capitulum lack stamens but have fertile ovaries and styles and the florets towards the inside of the capitulum are bisexual (both fertile stamens and ovaries will be present). In some cases the bisexual florets will vastly outnumber the female florets of which there may be only a few present on the periphery of the capitulum.

* #### Inner disc florets functionally male and outer disc florets bisexual

  In this state the florets towards the outer edge of the capitulum are bisexual (both fertile stamens and ovaries will be present) and the florets towards the inside of the capitulum appear bisexual but have infertile ovaries which abort and do not produce fertile seed. When in flower before fruiting it may be difficult to determine whether the female reproductive organs are fertile. Consequently, to help avoid misidentification taxa that technically match this state are also scored as having all florets bisexual.

* #### Inner disc florets functionally male and outer disc florets female

  In this state the florets towards the outer edge of the capitulum are female without stamens and the florets towards the inside of the capitulum appear bisexual but have infertile ovaries which abort and do not produce fertile seed. When in flower before fruiting it may be difficult to determine whether the female reproductive organs are fertile. Consequently, to help avoid misidentification taxa that technically match this state are also scored as having inner disc florets bisexual and outer disc florets female.

* #### Inner disc florets functionally female and outer disc florets female

  In this state the florets towards the outer edge of the capitulum are female without stamens and the florets towards the inside of the capitulum appear bisexual but have infertile stamens that do not produce fertile pollen. Determining that the inner florets are functionally female can be difficult, so to help avoid misidentification taxa that technically match this state are also scored as having inner disc florets bisexual and outer disc florets female. This state occurs only in the alpine *Ewartia nubigena* and the introduced *Petasites pyrenaicus*.

* #### Inner disc florets bisexual outer disc florets neuter

  In this state the florets towards the inside of the capitulum have both fertile stamens and ovaries and the florets towards the outside of the capitulum lack stamens and styles. This state occurs only in the introduced genus *Centaurea*.

* #### All florets functionally female with 4 or 5 abortive stamens

  In this state all the florets appear bisexual however the stamens are abortive. This state occurs only in the rare *Cratystylis conocephala* from the north-west of the state.

* #### All florets functionally male

  In this state all the florets appear bisexual however no fertile seed is produced. This may be difficult to determine before fruiting and consequently taxa that match this state are also scored as the state all florets bisexual.

* #### All florets female

  In this state all the florets lack stamens.

* #### Disc florets bisexual ray florets female

  In this state the disc florets have fertile stamens, styles and ovaries and the ray florets that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum lack stamens.

* #### Disc florets bisexual ray florets neuter

  In this state the disc florets have fertile stamens, styles and ovaries and the ray florets that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum lack stamens and styles.

* #### Disc florets functionally male and ray florets female

  In this state the disc florets have fertile stamens and appear bisexual, but the ovaries are not fertile and so these florets do not produce fertile seed. The ray florets that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum lack stamens and produce fertile seed. It can be difficult to appreciate that the disc florets are functionally male before fruiting and consequently taxa that technically match this state are also scored as disc florets bisexual ray florets female.

* #### Inner disc florets functionally male, outer disc florets bisexual and ray florets neuter

  In this state the disc florets towards the inside of the disc fertile stamens and appear bisexual, but the ovaries are not fertile and so these florets do not produce fertile seed and the disc florets on the outer edge of the disc have fertile stamens, styles and ovaries and can produce fertile seed. The ray florets that that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum lack stamens and styles. It can be difficult to appreciate that the disc florets towards the inside of the disc are functionally male before fruiting and consequently taxa that technically match this state are also scored as disc florets bisexual ray florets neuter. This state occurs only in the introduced genus *Gazania*.

### Number of florets

This character requires the user to determine which of the five number intervals (states) provided matches the total number of florets (regardless of floret type) that is present in the capitulum.

* #### 1 floret  

  In this state a single floret will be present surrounded by involucral bracts.

* #### Greater than 20

  The vast majority of taxa match this character state as most Asteraceae have capitula with many florets, often many hundred.

### Number of ray florets

This character requires the user to enter the number of ray florets that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum. This character is only applicable to radiate capitula (i.e. capitula with disc florets towards the inside of the capitula and ray florets that radiate on the outer edge of the capitulum) and does not include ligulifloral capitula (i.e. capitula with only ligulate florets).

### Receptacle scales or bristles

This character refers to scales (flattened structures that are often membranous) or bristles (stiff hair-like structures that are often coloured) borne on the receptacle surface near the base of florets. It does not include thin, sparse or cobwebby hairs that may be present between florets on the receptacle.

* #### Receptacle scales or bristles present

  In this state either scales or bristles are present on the receptacle surface near the base of florets.

* #### Receptacle scales or bristles absent

  In this state both scales and bristles are absent on the receptacle surface near the base of florets.

## Involucral Bract

This set of five characters refers to the structures that form on the outside of the capitulum and protect it when in bud. They do not contain reproductive organs (which the florets of a capitulum usually have) and are not petaloid (i.e. a combination of soft, flexible and white or coloured).

### Involucral bract form

This character refers to the texture and appearance of the involucral bracts and contains three states.

* #### Burr at maturity

  This state refers to involucral bracts that envelop at least some of the florets and harden and enlarge on maturity to become a prickly exterior to the cypsela which it is shed with. It occurs in the introduced genera *Acanthospermum*, *Ambrosia* and *Xanthium*.

* #### Papery, hyaline or membranous

  This state refers to involucral bracts that are stiff, paper-like and white or coloured in some part of the bract or bracts that are thin, clear and more or less transparent.

* #### Herbaceous

  This state refers to involucral bracts that are mostly green. Usually such bracts are leaf-like but in many cases they may be hardened and stiff particularly near the base or tip of the bract or along its midrib. Bracts in this state may have membranous or papery margins but in such cases will have a prominent green section around the midrib.

### Involucral bract indument

This character refers to the presence of hairs on any of the surfaces of the involucral bracts and includes three states.

* #### All bracts glabrous

  In this state all the bracts lack hairs.

* #### Some bracts with eglandular hairs

  In this state at least some of the bracts on some part of their surface possess hairs that end in a point (i.e. not tipped by a round gland). Some taxa may have both eglandular hairs and glandular hairs (i.e. hairs that are tipped by a round gland). Either state can be chosen for such taxa.

* #### Some bracts with glandular hairs

  In this state at least some of the bracts on some part of their surface possess hairs that are glandular (i.e. tipped by a round gland). Some taxa may have both glandular hairs and eglandular hairs (i.e. hairs that are not tipped by a round gland). Either state can be chosen for such taxa.

### Number of series

This character refers to the number of rows of involucral bracts present in a capitulum and contains two states.

* #### One series sometimes with smaller calyculus

  In this state there is a single row of bracts but occasionally a few very small bracts (calyculus) may be present at the base of the prominent much longer single row of bracts.

* #### More than one series

  In this state there are often clearly several overlapping rows of bracts and these are often of a different size or shape. Occasionally two very distinct but obvious sets of bracts are present and often the bracts appear spirally arranged.

### Number for capitula with a single series of bracts
This character requires the user to enter the number of involucral bracts in capitula that contain only a single prominent series of bracts. This character is not applicable to taxa with more than one series of involucral bracts.

### Involucral bract spines

This character refers to the presence of stiff sharp spines typically at the apex of involucral bracts that are usually painful to touch and contains two states.

* #### Involucral bract spines present

  In this state stiff sharp spines that are usually painful to touch are present somewhere on at least some of the involucral bracts.

* #### Involucral bract spines absent

  In this state stiff sharp spines that are usually painful to touch are absent from all of the involucral bracts.

## Ray or ligulate floret

This set of two characters refer to the zygomorphic (symmetric about one vertical plane only) floret types.

### Length of longest ligule

This character requires the user to enter the length in mm of the longest ligule (expanded petaloid part of the floret).

### Colour of adaxial surface

This character refers to the colour of the upper surface of the ray or ligulate florets and contains four states.

* #### White or cream

  This state includes pure white and all cream-like colours that are not clearly yellow. Faint colours (e.g. blue, yellow, red) are included in other states.

## Anther

The anthers in Asteraceae are fused and form a cylinder around the style. They may not be noticeable unless viewing with the aid of a microscope. The single anther character is minute and will require the use of a microscope to use.

### Base

This character refers to the shape of the base of the anther where the free filament attaches to it and will require the use of a microscope to see properly. It contains two states.

* #### Tailed or sagittate

  In this state the base of the anther extends below where the filament is attached so that a tail-like structure forms or the filaments appear to be inserted at the apex of an arrow.

* #### Obtuse, acute or truncate

In this state the base of the anther does not extend below where the filament is attached.

## Pappus

The pappus are the structures (often hairs, bristles or scales) that are situated at the apex of the ovary and at the base of the corolla (petals) and are equivalent to the sepals. There are four pappus characters provided.

### Pappus length

This character requires the user to enter in a length of one of the pappus from base to apex in mm.

### Pappus form

This character refers to the appearance of the pappus and contains eight states.

* #### Pappus absent

  In this state there is a complete absence of any structure in the position where pappus would be expected.

* #### Cup, rim, corona or crown of bristles or scales less than 0.5 mm high

  In this state a raised area or set of structures less than 0.5 mm high appears in the position where pappus would be expected.

* #### Scales

  In this state the pappus has a flattened form.

* #### Scales with an awn extension

  In this state the pappus has a flattened form with a stiff bristle-like extension at its apex.

* #### Smooth, scabrid or barbellate bristle or hair

  In this state the pappus is thin and cylindrical and looks like hairs. These may be smooth or have minute bumps or prickles along their length.

* #### Bristle plumose throughout entire length

  In this state the pappus has a main axis that is thin and cylindrical which bears several smaller hairs along its entire length often giving an overall feathery appearance.

* #### Bristle plumose in upper part only

  In this state the pappus has a main axis that is thin and cylindrical which bears several smaller hairs near the apex.

* #### Barbed or hairy awns

  In this state the pappus is stiff and has a main axis that bears hairs or barbs.

### Pappus uniformity

This character refers to whether all the florets of a capitulum have a similar form of pappus or not and contains two states.

* #### All florets with a similar form of pappus

  This state refers to taxa which have all their florets with a similar form and arrangement of pappus. On a single floret it is possible to have pappus of differing size and form but if this is the case all other florets in the same capitulum will also have the same pattern of differing pappus.

* #### Pappus on some florets different to the pappus on others

  This state refers to taxa which have some of their florets bearing pappus that is of a different form or size to the pappus of other florets (e.g. some taxa will have pappus on some florets but other florets will have no pappus).

### Pappus number

This character requires the user to determine which of the five number intervals (states) provided matches the total number of pappus that is present on a single floret.

* #### 0

  This state is applicable to taxa with no pappus.

* #### 1

  This state is applicable to taxa where a single hair or bristle is present or for taxa where the pappus is in the form of a rim or raised area in the position where pappus would be expected.

* #### Greater than 8

  Most taxa will match this interval.

## Cypsela

This group of six characters deals with features of the fruit (cypsela). Only mature cypsela that have finished flowering should be used for these characters.

### Cypsela length

This character requires the user to measure and enter the length in millimetres (mm) of the cypsela, not including the pappus (see Pappus for definition). For taxa that have an distinct elongated section (beak) between the seed containing part of the cypsela and the pappus, this beak is included in the measurement. For taxa that have wings only measure the length of the seed containing part of the cypsela. For taxa where the cypselas are totally concealed within hardened prickly involucral bracts to form a burr, measure the entire burr.

### Shape

This character refers to the shape of the cypsela excluding any wings that may be present and includes five states.

* #### Globose

  This state refers to cypselas that are globose or spherical in shape. Only a single widespread introduced species, *Chrysanthemoides monilifera*, has this character state.

* #### Terete, cylindric, linear, ovoid, obloid, or fusiform

  This state includes all shapes of cypsela that are not clearly wider towards the apex and are not distinctly elongated towards the apex.

* #### Obovoid, cuneate, cuneoid, turbinate, or obconical

  This state includes all shapes of cypsela that are clearly wider towards the apex.

* #### Lageniform or beaked

  This state includes cypsela that are distinctly elongated towards the apex.

* #### T- or Y-shaped

 This state includes a single species, *Ceratogyne obionoides*, that is confined to the far north-west of Victoria and has distinctive T- or Y-shaped cypselas.

### Cypsela uniformity

This character refers to whether all the florets of a capitulum produce similar cypselas or not and includes two states.

* #### All cypselas similar

  This character refers to whether all the florets of a capitulum produce cypselas of a similar shape, size, colour and indumentum.

* #### Cypselas of differing shape, colour, size or indumentum

  This character refers to whether all the florets of a capitulum produce cypselas of differing shape, size, colour and indumentum. Some cypselas may have a different appearance because they are sterile. Taxa that produce different appearing sterile cypselas are included in this state.

### Cypsela indument

This character refers to the presence of hairs (not including the pappus) on the surface of the cypsela and includes three states. Often the hairs are minute and will require the aid of a microscope to see.

* #### Cypsela glabrous or papillose

  In this state the cypsela lacks hairs, the surface is only covered by glands or warts or the surface is composed of minute finger-like extensions (papillae).

* #### Cypsela with eglandular hairs

  In this state at least some part of the cypsela surface possesses hairs that end in a point (i.e. not tipped by a round gland). Some taxa may have both eglandular and glandular hairs (i.e. hairs that are tipped by a round gland). Either state can be chosen for such taxa.

* #### Cypsela with glandular hairs

  In this state at least some part of the cypsela surface possesses hairs that are glandular (i.e. tipped by a round gland). Some taxa may have both glandular and eglandular hairs (i.e. hairs that are not tipped by a round gland). Either state can be chosen for such taxa.

### Cypsela wings

This character refers to the presence of thin wing-like extensions of the cypsela and contains two states.

* #### Cypsela wings present

  In this state the cypsela have one to many thin wing-like extensions.

* #### Cypsela wings absent

  In this state the cypsela has no thin wing-like extensions. There may be raised ribs but these will not be thin and wing-like.

### Cypsela ribs

This character refers to the presence of ridges which typically run longitudinally along the cypsela and contains two states.

* #### Cypsela ribs present

  In this state the cypsela has ridges.

* #### Cypsela ribs absent

  In this state the cypsela has no clear ridges.
