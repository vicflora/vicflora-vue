## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

The Snowfields Region is naturally defined as the area that extends up from the lower limit (during winter) of regularly snow-covered ground (generally between 900 and 1300 metres). This altitude range approximates to the lower limit of _Eucalyptus delegatensis_-dominated forests. The mapping of this region has proved difficult because of the highly dissected nature of the terrain. Furthermore, although montane, sub-alpine, and alpine conditions are generally zoned according to elevation (Costin 1957), temperature inversions in valleys and upland plains situated at montane elevations frequently produce high mountain conditions. Areas where communities of _E. delegatensis_ occur without associated sub-alpine or alpine communities (e.g. Mt Donna Buang, Mt Ellery and Mt Macedon) have not been included within the Snowfields Region.

There are several outliers, namely Mt Buffalo, Lake Mountain–Mt Torbrek, Mt Baw Baw, Mt Singleton, and Mt Skene.

## Major landforms

The high mountain region of south-eastern mainland Australia is part of an uplifted plateau that is bounded mostly by dissected valleys. The ‘palaeoplain’ (Mesozoic low-level plain) in Victoria is so dissected that only isolated small plateaus remain (now known as the High Plains of Victoria) (Ollier, in Barlow 1986, fig. 3). Examples of these isolated plateaus are the Baw Baw Plateau, the Buffalo Plateau, the Dargo High Plains, and the Bogong High Plains. Before and throughout the last glacial period the Victorian alps were probably eroded by normal rivers that had fairly low gradients on a plateau (glacial activity being confined to a small part of the Kosciusko range) (Ollier, in Barlow 1986).

The average elevation of this region is higher than the other regions, with the plateaus lying mainly at elevations of between 915 and 1525 metres (Hills 1940). Several peaks are above 1800 metres (e.g. Mt Bogong, 1986 m; Mt Feather-top, 1922 m; Mt Hotham, 1862 m; Mt Buller, 1804 m). The Buffalo and Baw Baw Plateaus represent remnants of an Upper Devonian granitic intrusion that has been uplifted and deeply eroded, whereas the Dargo and Bogong High Plains consist mostly of gneisses, with Basalt Hill, Mt Jim, Ruined Castle and other small areas being flat-topped lava residuals. Most of the remaining high country (e.g. Mt Howitt, Mt Wellington) comprises sandstones and mudstones, a notable exception being the Snowy River Volcanics of the Cobberas and nearby ranges (refer to Hills 1940; and Douglas, this volume; for further details). There is a wide variety of soil types, ranging from coarse lithosols, through alpine humus soils, to peats and snowpatch soils (Costin, in Barlow 1986; Gibbons and Rowan, this volume).

## Climate

The prevailing north-westerly to south-westerly winds provide most of the predominantly winter precipitation. In winter the precipitation is mainly as snow, and in summer it is often, but not always, as heavy thunderstorms. The average annual precipitation is about 750–2000 mm occurring over about 120–140 days per year (subalpine tract), and 1750–3000 mm in about 130–150 days (alpine tract) (Costin 1957). During summer, the mean monthly maximum temperatures rise to about 16–24°C (subalpine tract), and to about 10–16°C (alpine tract). During winter the mean monthly minimum temperatures fall to about –4 to –1 °C (subalpine tract), and to below – 4°C (alpine tract). The mean monthly minimum temperatures are less than or equal to 0°C for about 6–8 months. See also ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

### Montane forests and woodlands

#### Eucalyptus delegatensis forests

_Eucalyptus delegatensis_-dominated tall open-forests (reaching heights of 60–70 metres) or tall woodlands occur in well-drained, deep soils on moderately steep slopes at elevations of 900–1500 metres. The mean annual precipitation (mostly as rain, although snowfalls are common in winter) varies from 1000–1500 mm, with below 0°C temperatures for 3–4 months during winter (Beadle 1981). The understorey is mesomorphic, and usually with an abundance of tree-ferns. The common understorey species include _Acacia frigescens_, _A. melanoxylon_, _Atherosperma moschatum_, _Bedfordia arborescens_, _Dicksonia antarctica_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Tasmannia lanceolata_ and _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ (at Mt Baw Baw this latter species extends into the Snow-gum woodlands). As the sites become less favourable (drier or with poorer soils), _Eucalyptus dalrympleana_ occurs as a co-dominant and becomes progressively more abundant. The understorey also becomes xeromorphic. The common understorey species include _Acacia dealbata_ and _Lomatia fraseri_. The montane communities dominate the hilly to mountainous country below the Snow-gum woodland, and often form an ecotonal association with _Eucalyptus pauciflora_. On the wetter (western) slopes of the Bogong High Plains _E. delegatensis_-dominated forests occur below Snow-gum woodland, whereas the eastern (rainshadow) slopes near Omeo (Eastern Highlands) support a drier forest type (montane sclerophyll woodland), typically of _E. rubida_, _E. macrorhyncha_ and/or _E. dives_. Contrary to this, near Mt Hotham, this community occurs on slopes with an easterly aspect, whereas _E. pauciflora_ occurs on slopes with a westerly aspect, both at similar altitudes. At lower altitudes, the montane woodland/forest forms ecotonal associations with _E. cypellocarpa_, _E. radiata_ and _E. viminalis_. However, the transition from the forests of lower elevations to the montane forest is frequently very distinct. For example, near McKinnons Corner (at about 1000 metres altitude), on the main road to the top of the Mt Buffalo plateau, there is a readily recognizable change from the _Eucalyptus mannifera_/_E. rubida_-dominated montane sclerophyll woodland to the _E. delegatensis_-dominated montane forest.

#### Snow-gum woodland

_Eucalyptus pauciflora_ and _E. niphophila_ (Snow-gums) usually dominate woodlands at elevations of about 1100–1837 metres, but commonly extend to lower altitudes in areas of cold air drainage and frost hollows. Disjunct communities of _E. pauciflora_ occur in other regions (e.g. [Grampians](./grampians) and [Midlands](./midlands); refer to these regions for details). This community occurs on a wide range of soil types (Costin 1954), but the soils are consistently rich in organic material and never waterlogged. The closed- or open-heathland communities (see below) usually extend into the Snow-gum woodland. Hence, the understorey typically comprises those species that occur in these heathlands. The ground-layer is characteristically dominated by \_Poa\* spp. A mallee-like form of _E. pauciflora_ occurs at Mt Hotham (Beadle 1981, fig. 11.1), with an understorey of _Bossiaea foliosa_ and _Ozothamnus hookeri_. Localized populations of _Eucalyptus mitchelliana_ associate with Snow-gum woodland on Mt Buffalo.

The _E. stellulata_ alliance is often associated with _E. pauciflora_. However, it replaces the latter species on waterlogged soils (Figure 6.24). It commonly occurs on lower slopes in frost-pockets occupied by _Poa_-dominated grasslands.

The _E. niphophila_ alliance occurs at higher altitudes (to treeline, about 2000 metres) than _E. pauciflora_. The trees are 6–10 metres high, and are usually wind-shorn. The mean annual precipitation is 750–2000 mm, and snow lies for 1–4 months (Beadle 1981). The understorey is discontinuous, and typically includes _Bossiaea foliosa_, _Grevillea australis_, _Orites lancifolia_ and _Oxylobium alpestre_. The ground-layer is usually dense, with the common species including _Celmisia asteliifolia_ (_sensu lato_), _Danthonia nudiflora_, _Poa hiemata_ and _Ranunculus_ spp. This woodland grades into _Eucalyptus pauciflora_ woodland at lower elevations, whereas at higher elevations it is replaced by heathlands and grasslands.

### Heathlands

#### Closed-heathlands

A closed-heath community is common near the treeline. The tall shrub canopy (1–2 metres high) is very dense, such that understorey plants are sparse. Characteristically, _Bossiaea foliosa_, _Orites lancifolia_, _Oxylobium alpestre_ and _Prostanthera cuneata_ provide most of the cover. Other common species include _Gonocarpus montanus_, _Grevillea australis_, _Hovea montana_ and _Poa fawcettiae_. _Hymenanthera dentata_, _Pimelea ligustrina_ and _P. axiflora_ subsp. _alpina_ are less common components of this community. Drier sites are dominated by _Acacia alpina_, _Baeckea ramosissima_ and _Phebalium squamulosum_ subsp. _alpinum_.

_Podocarpus lawrencei_ forms a closed-scrub/heathland (at elevations of 1400–1740 metres) in block streams, well-drained rocky sites, and on boulder-scree slopes on the Bogong High Plains (e.g. Timms Lookout—north of Mt Spion Kopje and Mt Jim), Mts Higginbotham, Buffalo, Buller (Scott 1974), Cobberas and Howitt. Although few other species occur in this community, common associates include _Blechnum penna-marina_, _Olearia phlogopappa_, _Polystichum proliferum_ and _Tasmannia xerophila_. A low alpine shrubland subcommunity (ALP 2.1 of Walsh, Barley & Gullan 1983, 1984, 1986), dominated by _Oxylobium alpestre_, _Olearia phlogopappa_, _\*Rumex acetosella_, _Tasmannia xerophila_ and _Stellaria pungens_, is possibly a grazing- and/or fire-induced variant of the _Podocarpus_ heathland. This subcommunity occurs on the upper slopes of Mts Buller, Magdala and Stirling.

#### Open-heathlands

Open-heathland is the most common community on the Bogong High Plains. The shrub-layer is short (0.3–0.7 metre high), with the spaces between the shrubs occupied by herbs and tussock grasses. The shrub-layer is very diverse, with _Grevillea australis, Hovea montana, Leucopogon hookeri_ and _Orites lancifolia_ the most common components of the community (Plate 6f). Other common species include _Bracteantha subundulata, Olearia phlogopappa_ var. _subrepanda_, _Ozothamnus alpinus_, _O. hookeri_, _Stylidium graminifolium_ and _Wahlenbergia ceracea_. The Alpine Walking Track from Cope Saddle to Mt Jim on the Bogong High Plains passes through extensive examples of open-heathland, alternating with _Poa hiemata_ grassland and _Poa costiniana_ grassland. The Bogong High Plains Tourist Road (especially between Mt Cope and Langford Gap) also passes through large areas of open-heathland. Other examples of this community occur near Mt Nelse, Hollonds Knob, Marm Point, Mt Buller (Scott 1974) and below the _Poa hiemata_ grassland on Mt Bogong and Hooker Plateau.

The rocky alpine areas support another open-heathland subcommunity that is characterized by rock-loving herbs (e.g. _Brachyscome rigidula_, _Crassula sieberiana_, _Leucochrysum albicans_ and _Luzula novae-cambriae_) (Plate 6g). It occurs in rocky gullies, on shale and scree slopes, in rocky crevices and on isolated rocky outcrops (e.g. Mt Buffalo, the Cobberas, the Twins, Mt Blue Rag, the rocky peaks of the Delatite, Jamieson and Macalister River catchments, and Ruined Castle on the Bogong High Plains). The dominant grass is usually _Poa fawcettiae_, _P. hothamensis_ or _P. phillipsiana_).

#### Kunzea heathland

This heathland is characteristic of the alpine region, occurring at elevations of 1380-1740 metres. The dominant species is _Kunzea ericifolia_. Here, it is a prostrate shrub that spreads over the boulders and gravelly soils. Walsh, Barley and Gullan (1983, 1984, 1986) recognize four subcommunities within the _Kunzea_ heathland community. Common species occurring in this heathland include _Asperula gunnii_, _Brachyscome spathulata_, _Carex breviculmis_, _Epacris gunnii_, _Hovea montana_, _Leucochrysum albicans_ subsp. _alpinum_, _Micrantheum hexandrum_ (on Mt Buffalo), _Microseris lanceolata_, _Poa fawcettiae_, _P. phillipsiana_, _Senecio lautus_ and _Trisetum spicatum_. This community is well developed on the Bogong High Plains and on Mt Buffalo, Mt Wellington and the Snowy Range area. The original character and distribution of these communities have been significantly modified by grazing and fires (Costin 1957).

### Subalpine and alpine tussock-grasslands

Tall, robust tussocks of _Poa costiniana_ form a dense grassland in association with relatively few other species. Shrubs are rare. Species commonly occurring in this grassland include _Brachyscome tadgellii_ (especially in shallow depressions), _Cardamine lilacina_, _Colobanthus affinis_, _Microseris lanceolata_ and _Veronica serpyllifolia_. This community occurs on all basalt cappings of the Bogong High Plains (McDougall 1982b, 1982c, 1984) (e.g. at Ruined Castle). The alpine tracks from Cope Saddle and from Basalt Temple to Ta-wonga Huts pass through extensive examples of this community. Depressions and small creeks, with their associated communities (e.g. _Carex appressa_ and _Poa helmsii_), occur throughout the _Poa costiniana_ grassland.

_Poa hiemata_-dominated grassland occurs at lower elevations (usually occurring below the _P. costiniana_ grassland) (e.g. Pretty Valley, alpine track near north of Mt Cope, and the Howitt Plain), mainly on soils derived from metamorphic rocks (McDougall 1982b, 1982c, 1984, 1985). This community occurs on flat to gently sloping areas. Shrubs are either absent or sparse. This grassland is generally more open than the _Poa costiniana_ grassland, with herbs usually abundant between the tussocks. Common species include several species of _Craspedia_ and _Euphrasia_, _Luzula modesta_ × _L. novae-cambriae_ and _Stackhousia monogyna_. On the Howitt Plain the most common species in this community include _Asperula gunnii_, _Brachyscome decipiens_, _Cotula alpina_, _Hypericum japonicum_, _Ranunculus graniticola_, _R. gunnianus_ and _Viola betonicifolia_. One of the weediest and species-poor subcommunities of _Poa hiemata_ grassland occurs on the Dargo High Plains (sub-community ALP 7.3 of Walsh, Barley & Gullan 1983, 1984, 1986). Areas of the Dargo High Plains are heavily stocked and grazed by cattle.

Small tree-bordered, subalpine grasslands occur at elevations of 1200–1600 metres (e.g. Wire Plain—east of Hotham Heights), where the accumulation of cold air prohibits the growth of _Eucalyptus pauciflora_. Tall tussocks of _Poa labillardierei_ dominate the grassland, with several species occurring between the tussocks (e.g. _Ranunculus lappaceus_ and _R. pimpinellifolius_, and several species of _Daviesia_, _Dianella_, _Diuris_, _Hakea_, _Hypericum_ and _Hypoxis_). These grasslands are generally surrounded by _Eucalyptus stellulata_ woodlands.

### Subalpine and alpine bog communities

Subalpine and alpine bog communities are restricted to permanently wet drainage lines and the upper reaches of streams. Walsh, Barley and Gullan (1983, 1984, 1986) classify the bog communities as wet alpine heathland. _Sphagnum_ is the characteristic moss of these bogs. On the slightly drier sites, tall shrubs, such as _Epacris paludosa_, often form an almost impenetrable upper stratum, with _Sphagnum_ less abundant. This community is well developed on the Bogong High Plains (e.g. along the upper reaches of Cope Creek, and in the Langford Gap area), Mt Baw Baw, the Snowy Range area, Mt Buffalo, Dargo and Davies Plains, and at Echo Flat (Lake Mountain). The bog community characteristically occurs on black peat up to at least 2 metres deep (Ashton & Hargreaves 1983), frequently overlying a dark grey clay and gravel zone. _Sphagnum subsecundum_ occupies the wetter sites (hollows) of the bogs (e.g. forming a subalpine bog community at Echo Flat, Lake Mountain), whereas _Sphagnum cristatum_ occurs on the drier hummocks (Ashton & Hargreaves 1983) (Figure 6.25). Common species of the bog include _Astelia alpina_, _Asperula gunnii_, _Baeckea gunniana_, _Celmisia asteliifolia_ (_sensu lato_), _Colobanthus affinis_, _Craspedia_ spp., _Empodisma minus_, _Gentianella diemensis_, _Myriophyllum pedunculatum_, _Orites lancifolia_, _Richea continentis_ and _Stackhousia pulvinaris_. Many of these species colonize the slightly drier hummocks of the bog.

## Land use

During the warmer months (principally November to April), the region is used for leisure activities, particularly bushwalking and sightseeing, and is grazed by cattle. In winter the principal leisure activity is snow skiing, with limited bush-walking in the more accessible areas. Some modification of the alpine vegetation has occurred as a result of clearing and/or revegetation of downhill ski-slopes and alpine resorts. Selective grazing of some native species and general trampling (which is non-selective) by cattle has also modified the vegetation in most parts of the region (Costin 1957; Carr & Turner 1959; Wimbush & Costin 1979; van Rees 1982, 1984; van Rees & Hutson 1983). On the Bogong High Plains cattle spend the largest proportion of their grazing and resting time in the open grassy-heath and grassland communities (van Rees & Hutson 1983). Bare ground is created in both grasslands and heathlands by the activity of cattle as a result of grazing, trampling, urine scalds and deposition of dung (Carr & Turner 1959; McDougall 1982a; Williams 1985). These bare areas provide a suitable site for the establishment of shrub seedlings (Williams & Ashton 1987b). Williams and Ashton (1987b) conclude that the likely consequences of continued cattle grazing are difficult to predict, but suggest that current grazing practices will continually provide microsites suitable for the establishment of shrub seedlings in preference to grassland species. Continued grazing within the Bogong National Park is not compatible with strict values of nature conservation, especially as the alpine and subalpine flora of Australia has evolved in the absence of intense grazing pressure by herbivores in general, and hooved animals in particular.
