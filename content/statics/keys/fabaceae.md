## Introduction

The multi-access key to the Fabaceae of Victoria is a key to the 309 Fabaceae taxa other than Acacia that are known to occur in Victoria, both native and introduced. A separate multi-access key is provided for Acacia. It is a modified version of ‘The Pea Key’ produced by the Australian Pea-flowered Legume Research Group that is applicable only to species present in Victoria. It contains 50 characters to help distinguish taxa from each other with, including place of occurrence, plant size, and several morphological features both vegetative and reproductive. It differs from the dichotomous keys provided in VicFlora by giving the user the flexibility to choose from one of the 50 characters provided rather than the user having to commit to investigate the particular features being questioned in the dichotomous keys. This has the benefit of:

1. avoiding having to answer questions relating to a feature that may not be present in the sample when being identified,

2. potentially being able to identify a taxon without needing to comprehend the most technical terminology and

3. allowing the rapid identification of taxa with distinct features rarely encountered in the family

To use the key the user selects a feature from the features in the top left Features Available panel and clicks on the state present in their specimen to be identified. Once selected this feature and state will show as being selected in the Features Chosen panel directly below the Features Available panel. To undo a selection, click on the box next to the state chosen in the Features Chosen panel to erase the tick in the box. Once a feature state is chosen all the taxa that do not possess the chosen feature state are discarded in the bottom right Entities Discarded panel and those that do possess the chosen feature state are retained in the top right Entities Remaining panel. The user continues to choose further character states present in their specimen until identification is achieved. To restart the key when finished select the restart key icon represented by the two green arrows in the top left corner of the screen.

## General helpful hints

For the most effective use of this key the user is encouraged to read the help guides for each character and state before submitting an answer for that character and state. Help guides and photographs can be found by clicking on the page icons beside characters and states. This help will reduce the chance of misinterpretation of the character and state. Some information and definitions required for interpreting a state may be given under character so users are encouraged to read the help guide for the characters before the states. When taking measurements or assessing which state a character exists in for the taxon being identified a typical plant and plant part should be used. Typical is here interpreted as a close representation of the average plant in terms of size and stature in a population and a plant part that represents the average condition for that character (e.g. average length, the most frequently observed shape etc.). The characters provided concern the adult plant and consequently when using these characters the plant chosen should be reproductively mature. For some of the characters it is possible for some taxa to possess more than one character state for the character. In such cases either correct character state can be chosen. When taking measurements be precise e.g. if a leaf is 5.9 mm long enter 5.9 mm long rather than rounding up to 6 mm and entering that.

To help identify the specimen to be identified as quickly as possible the best option can be used. This option highlights which characters should be used first to discard the maximum number of taxa among the remaining taxa. To use the best option select the best icon given as a blue wand at the top of the screen. For some similar taxa such as closely related species or subspecies within a species it may become time consuming to keep using the key until one taxon remains. In such instances the user can use the dichotomous key and profiles to help distinguish between the remaining similar species.

- #### Leaves present, but modified to phyllodes

  In this state part of the leaf has become lost and it is the petiole (leaf stalk) that becomes flattened and assumes the photosynthetic role. Species that produce phyllodes often also produce non-modified leaves of a different appearance to the phyllode when young. There are transitional phases where a plant will produce both its juvenile foliage of non-modified leaves and mature phyllodes. In such situation will it become evident whether the photosynthetic organ is a non-modified leaf or phyllode.

  In this state the wings will hide the keel when the flower is viewed from the side because the wings are longer than the keel.

- #### Wings shorter than keel

  In this state the keel will be visible when the flower is viewed from the side because the wings are shorter than the keel.

### Stamen fusion

This character refers to whether the filaments are joined and if so how. When assessing this character it will be necessary to pull down the keel to expose the stamens that typically lie within. When doing this be careful to only grasp the keel and not some of the filaments inside which are delicate and easily broken. This is particularly important for species with the 9 stamens fused with 1 free because the 1 free stamen is easily removed giving the impression that all stamens are fused.

  In this state nine of the filaments are fused together forming a tube that is parted to the base along one side and one filament remains free in the part of the tube. All filaments are free towards their ends near the anthers.

- #### More than 10 stamens fused at base

  In this state there are more than 10 stamens that are only fused close to the base. Among Victorian species, this state is present only in _Paraserianthes lophantha_.

## Pod and seed

A set of 10 characters associated with the fruit and seeds.

### Pod shape

This character refers to outline shape of the fruit wall.

- #### Pod linear

  This shape is much longer than wide with sides that are more or less parallel or curved and equidistant for most of their length.

- #### Pod oblong

  This shape has a similar width to length or is up to a few times longer than wide and the sides are more or less parallel for most of their length.

- #### Pod elliptic

  This shape is an ellipse or oval.

- #### Pod circular

  This shape resembles a circle.

- #### Pod ovate

  This shape is widest near the base and egg-shaped.

- #### Pod obovate

  This shape resembles a club or an egg with its widest point near the tip at the opposite end to where the fruit is attached to the plant.

- #### Pod triangular

  This shape resembles a triangle.

- #### Pod moniliform

  In this state the fruit is constricted between where the seeds are, which gives a beaded appearance to the fruit like a bead necklace.

- #### Pod transversely jointed

  In this state the fruit appears segmented with each seed belonging to what appears to be a separate segment joined to the adjacent segments. This makes the fruit look moniliform but with lines dividing each seeded segment.

- #### Pod constricted along one margin

  In this state the fruit appears segmented with each seed belonging to what appears to be a separate segment joined to the adjacent segments. One edge of the fruit is straight sided and the other appears moniliform.

- #### Pod other

  This state is any other shaped that do not comfortably match the other provided shapes.

### Pod transverse section

This character refers to how flat the fruit is.

- #### Pod flat

  In this state the fruit is flat and does not have a noticeable inner cavity volume.

- #### Pod rounded or inflated

  In this state there is an inner cavity where the seeds sit that has a noticeable volume. If a cut is made through the fruit at right angles to its attachment (transverse section) this cut would leave a circular or oval shape.

### Pod bilocular

This character refers to how many cavities exist within the fruit.

- #### Bilocular

  In this state there are two cavities separated by a wall inside the fruit. If a cut is made through the fruit at right angles to its attachment (transverse section) two compartments would be visible for this state.

- #### Not bilocular

  In this state there is only a single cavity inside the fruit. If a cut is made through the fruit at right angles to its attachment (transverse section) one compartments would be visible for this state.

### Pod stipitate

This state refers to whether there is a stalk that elevates the fruit above where the sepals are attached.

- #### Stipitate

  In this state there is a stalk that elevates the fruit above where the sepals are attached.

- #### Sessile

  In this state the base of the fruit sits where the sepals are attached.

### Pod hairiness

This character refers to whether the outer surface of the fruit has hairs.

- #### Pod glabrous

  In this state the outer surface of the fruit is completely devoid of hairs.

- #### Pod hairy

  In this state the fruit has hairs on its outer surface. If the fruit is sparsely hairy or only the occasional small hair is seen on the outer surface select this state.

### Pod dehiscence

This character refers to whether the fruit opens to release the seeds and if so how this happens.

- #### Dehiscent completely to upper third

  In this state both lines on either side of the fruit split open from the tip to near the base of the fruit to release the seeds. In this state open fruit appear like a beak of a bird that is wide open.

- #### Dehiscent only in upper third

  In this state both lines on either side of the fruit split open from the tip to a third of the way towards the base of the fruit to release the seeds. In this state open fruit appear like a beak of a bird that is partially open.

- #### Dehiscent along only one suture

  In this state only one of the lines of the fruit splits open to release the seeds. In this state open fruit have a split along one side like a boat.

- #### Indehiscent

  In this state the fruit never split open in a regular way to release the seeds. The seeds germinate when the wall of the fruit has broken down. Old fruit has a similar appearance to young unripe fruit.

- #### Splitting into segments

  In this state the fruit splits into segments at points between where the seeds are held rather than longitudinally along a line of dehiscence.

### Pod length mm long

This is the length in mm from the tip of the fruit to where it is attached to a stalk or where the sepals are.

### Seed shape

This character refers to the shape of the seed.

- #### Seed bean-shaped

  In this state the seed is a kidney shape.

- #### Seed square or oblong

  In this state the seed is a square shape or is up to a few times longer than wide and the sides are more or less parallel for most of their length.

- #### Seed triangular

  In this state the seed is shaped like a triangle.

- #### Seed elliptic, ovate or obovate

  In this state the seed is shaped like an oval or an egg.

### Aril presence

This character refers to whether there is a fleshy protrusion or covering (aril) on the seed that is typically red, cream or white.

- #### Aril present

  In this state there is a fleshy protrusion or covering (aril) on the seed that is typically red, cream or white.

- #### Aril absent or minute

  In this state there is no clearly visible fleshy protrusion or covering (aril) on the seed that is typically red, cream or white.

### Number of seeds per pod

This character is the total number of seeds within a fruit. This includes aborted or poorly formed seeds.

## Occurrence

One character that refers to where a species can be found in Victoria.

### Distribution by Natural Region

Victoria has been divided into 16 natural regions. For this character the user determines which natural region the plant that is to be identified was found in to enter for this character. Whether a taxon is regarded as occurring in a particular natural region or not is dependent on whether the taxon has been previously documented as occurring in that natural region or not. There is a remote possible that a taxon occurs in a natural region but has not yet been documented in that natural region. In such a case the key will not recognise that taxon as occurring in that natural region which will result in a misidentification for the user. This issue may be particularly relevant to newly introduced species which may be still expanding their range through Victoria or for taxa that are not collected often. Due to these issues we suggest that this character be one of the first characters investigated as a potential reason for misidentification.
