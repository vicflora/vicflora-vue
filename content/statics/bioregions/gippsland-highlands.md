## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

The boundary of this region approximates the 150–200 metre elevation contour interval and so includes the Strzelecki Ranges. These ranges are an example of block mountains and, as such, are largely defined by the various geological faults (refer Hills 1940). This region is completely surrounded by the Gippsland Plain.

Major grids P and T. Approximate area 2232 km<sup>2</sup>.

## Major landforms

The present-day physiography of the region is a consequence of erosion of differentially uplifted blocks of late Mesozoic sediments (existing now as sandstones, mudstones and black coal). In places the Mesozoic sediments are overlain by more recent sediments (sands, gravels and brown coal) and lava flows (principally along the Morwell–Leongatha axis). The uplifted blocks have been weathered and strongly dissected, such that the resulting landscape is smooth and rounded (closely resembling that of the Otway Range). The nearly symmetrical V-shaped valleys often have very steep sides, commonly reaching 40°. Details of the geological history of the region are given in Anon. (1972b, 1980b), Douglas (this volume) and Jenkin (1971). The highest point in the region is Mt Tassie (740 m), with Mt Fatigue (586 m) and Mt Worth (518 m) the next highest points. The soils of the region are predominantly fertile loams and earths (Gibbons and Rowan, this volume).

## Climate

The region experiences a temperate climate with a predominantly winter rainfall maximum typical of the southern Australian coastline. Mean annual rainfall varies from about 900 to at least 1400 mm, with the wettest months usually being from May to October. Most of the rain-bearing winds are westerlies. This results in a rain-shadow zone to the east of the Strzelecki Ranges (Anon. 1980b). The temperatures are relatively mild throughout the region. Topography has a considerable influence on temperature. Higher elevations in the region have lower maxima and minima than localities at lower altitudes. Typical mean daily maxima range from 11°C to 24°C, with mean daily minima ranging from 2°C to 10°C. July is the coldest month, and February the warmest. Frosts are relatively frequent, especially in valleys. Snowfalls occur two or three times a year on the highest areas of the region. See also ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

## Vegetation

Most of the native vegetation of this region has been cleared for settlement. In many areas, the native plants have been completely replaced by alien pastures, crop plants, and weeds. There were once strong similarities between the floras of this region and the Otway Range, but this region has now lost far more of its native vegetation. For example, fern gullies now exist only in a few isolated localities. Remnants of the pre-European flora are scattered, and frequently are significantly disturbed.

### Forests

#### Cool temperate rainforest

A closed-forest dominated by _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ occurs in deep, protected gullies within the high rainfall areas of the region (Howard & Ashton 1973; Gullan et al. 1984; Seddon & Cameron 1985a, 1985b). _Atherosperma moschatum_ occurs as a sub-dominant or understorey species, together with _Acacia dealbata_ and _A. melanoxylon_. _Dicksonia antarctica_ is the most common tree-fern, but _Cyathea australis_ and _C. cunninghamii_ are also common. The trees and shrubs of the understorey include _Bedfordia arborescens_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Lomatia fraseri_, _Olearia argophylla_, _O. lirata_, _Pittosporum bicolor_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Polyscias sambucifolia_, _Rapanea howittiana_ and _Tasmannia lanceolata_. Common lianas include _Billardiera longiflora_, _Clematis aristata_, _C. glycinoides_ and _Parsonsia brownii_. The ground-layer is generally sparse under the closed canopy. It is dominated by _Fieldia australis_ (often an epiphyte), with _Australina pusilla_, _Sambucus gaudichaudiana_, _Tetrarrhena juncea_ and _Viola hederacea_ being common. The diverse fern flora includes terrestrial and epiphytic species. The common ferns include _Asplenium bulbiferum_, _Blechnum fluviatile_, _B. nudum_, _B. wattsii_, _Grammitis billardieri_, _Microsorum pustulatum_, _Polystichum proliferum_ and _Pteridium esculentum_ (particularly in disturbed areas) (Gullan et al. 1984). Rainforest remnants occur in the Tarra–Bulga National Park (Plate 6b). An ecotonal closed-forest that has elements of wet sclerophyll forest and cool temperate rainforest occurs in environments that are intermediate between the two communities.

#### Wet sclerophyll forest/damp sclerophyll forest

_Eucalyptus regnans_ dominates a tall open-forest on deep, loamy kraznozem soils, on wet highland slopes. This community is much less common in the region than it used to be. Extensive clearing by the early settlers, timber utilization and the devastating bushfires of 1898 and 1939 have resulted in few mature stands remaining (Gullan et al. 1984, 1985). _E. obliqua_ and _E. cypellocarpa_ are often co-dominants or associated species of this community. The understorey and ground layer species include _Acacia dealbata_, _A. melanoxylon_, _Australina pusilla_, _Bedfordia arborescens_, _Cassinia trinerva_, _Clematis aristata_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Olearia argophylla_, _O. lirata_, _O. phlogopappa_, _Pandorea pandorana_, _Parsonsia brownii_, _Phebalium bilobum_, _Poa labillardieri_, _P. sieberiana_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Prostanthera lasianthos_ and _Tetrarrhena juncea_ (Plate 6c). The understorey tree-ferns include _Cyathea australis_ and _Dicksonia antarctica_, with _Blechnum nudum_, _B. wattsii_, _Calochlaena dubia_, _Histiopteris incisa_, _Polystichum proliferum_ and _Pteridium esculentum_ forming the ground-layer ferns.

An open- to tall open-forest (damp sclerophyll forest) commonly occurs on well-drained, sandy loam soils in flat to undulating country of this region, and extends into the neighbouring Gippsland Plain to the south. This community is extremely variable, both floristically and structurally. The dominant eucalypts include _Eucalyptus consideniana_, _E. cypellocarpa_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. radiata._ The understorey is commonly dominated by _Acacia dealbata_, _A. mucronata_, _A. verticillata_, _Billardiera scandens_, _Cassinia aculeata_, _Epacris impressa_, _Gahnia radula_, _Gonocarpus tetragynus_, _G. teucrioides_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Lomandra filiformis_, _L. longifolia_, _Platylobium formosum_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Pteridium esculentum_, _Pultenaea juniperina_ and _Tetrarrhena juncea_. Examples of this community occur between Boolarra ([Gippsland Plain](./gippsland-plain) region) and Mirboo North.

### Woodlands

#### Leptospermum myrsinoides heathy woodland

This community is more common in the neighbouring Gippsland Plain, but occurs in this region in areas with sandy soils and mean annual rainfall 700–900 mm. The shrub-layer of this community is always dominated by the dense shrub _Leptospermum myrsinoides_. The tree-layer is usually well-developed and results in a woodland with a heathy understorey. _Eucalyptus consideniana_, _E. pryoriana_ and _E. radiata_ are the commonest tree species. The shrub-layer is typically dominated by sclerophyllous shrubs, such as _Aotus ericoides_, _Dillwynia glaberrima_, _Epacris impressa_, _Hibbertia acicularis_, _Leptospermum continentale_ and _Monotoca scoparia_.

## Land use

Since the destruction of most of the wet sclerophyll forest, damp sclerophyll forest has become the most heavily utilized community for timber production and allied forest products (e.g wood-chips) (Gullan et al. 1984, 1985).

Hardwood and softwood plantations are now being established on previously cleared areas. _Eucalyptus regnans_ and _Pinus radiata_ are the two most commonly planted species. The region is important for recreation. Much of the region has proved to have low potential for agricultural development; however, dairying and beef production are important primary industries.
