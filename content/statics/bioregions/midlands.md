## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

The northern and north-eastern boundary of the Midland Region approximates to the southern and south-eastern limits of the flat alluvial plains of the Riverina. In the north, the granitic outcrops of the Terrick Terrick area and those of the Warby Range area form outliers surrounded by the Riverina. In the north-west, this region adjoins the Wimmera. This boundary is frequently broad (up to a few kilometres wide), so that there is often a gradual transition from one region to the other. The western boundary coincides with the sandy outwash slope of the eastern ranges of the Grampians. The southern boundary represents the northern limit of the basalt lava flows of the Victorian Volcanic Plain that characteristically are almost treeless plains, except where the volcanic cones have well-developed forests remaining. This boundary is usually distinct, except in areas that have been extensively cleared. An outlier occurs in the Mt Mercer area (near Meredith). The south-eastern boundary approximates the 610-metre altitude contour shared with the Eastern Highlands, with the Eltham-Plenty-Coldstream area forming a disjunct area surrounded by the Victorian Volcanic Plain, Gippsland Plain and Eastern Highlands Regions.

This region is continuous with the South-western Slopes Region of New South Wales (Anderson 1947, 1961; Jacobs & Pickard 1981). It is recommended that the south-western boundary of the South-western Slopes should be as here modified (refer to map of Natural Regions of Victoria, endpapers), so that it ends near Albury–Wodonga, not near Yarrawonga (cf. Jacobs & Pickard 1981).

## Major landforms

The major landforms that characterize this region are the scattered mountain ranges that are separated by broad plains or broad undulating country. The plains are covered with alluvial deposits. Low ironstone-ridges of sedimentary origin occur to the north of Bendigo. The mountain ranges are composed of resistant rocks, such as hornfels (e.g. Mt Tarrangower, Mt Ararat, and Big Hill south of Bendigo), granites (e.g. Mt Cole, Mt Buangor, Ben Nevis, and the You Yangs), and Devonian dacites (e.g. Mt Macedon range). The mountain ranges are generally small, with the highest ranges being The Hump– Mt Macedon (1011 metres), Mt Buangor (989 metres), Mt Langi Ghiran (925 metres), Mt Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres). Large areas of this region form part of the western goldfields of Victoria, and characteristically these soils are usually quartz-rich, being derived from vein quartz. For detailed discussion of the origin of the landforms of the region, see Anon. (1980a); Ollier, in Barlow (1986); Douglas (this volume); and Gibbons and Rowan (this volume).

## Climate

This region has a relatively uniform climate; however, the various mountain ranges modify the local climate. The region experiences a temperate climate, with warm, dry summers (with January usually being the driest month) and cool to cold, wet winters (with June generally being the wettest month). Rain-bearing winds move across the plains in a south-westerly or north-westerly stream, and are lifted as they approach the ranges. Consequently, the plains generally receive less rain than the adjoining ranges. The mean annual rainfall varies from about 400 mm (in the north) to at least 750 mm (in the Pyrenees) and 719 mm (Ballarat) in the south. The mean annual rainfall for much of the northern slopes varies from 400–500 mm. January and February are the warmest months (Anon. 1978 & 1980a), with the northern areas being hotter than the more southern localities. The lowest temperatures occur in July. Frosts are common throughout the region (Anon. 1978). See also ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

## Vegetation

Large areas have been cleared for agriculture, with only remnants of the original vegetation occurring throughout much of the region.

### Wet woodlands and forests

#### Snow-gum woodland

The _Eucalyptus pauciflora_ (Snow-gum) dominated community is poorly developed, and is restricted to the summit areas of some of the higher peaks (e.g. Mt Cole State Forest and Mt Macedon area). At Lookout Hill (Mt Cole State Forest) a small snow-gum woodland occurs amongst the granitic boulders with a _Poa_ sp.-dominated ground-layer. Many exotic grasses are also present as a result of the disturbance caused by communications installations. Common herbs include _Brunonia australis_, _Lomandra longifolia_ and _Wahlenbergia_ spp.

#### Eucalyptus pauciflora (Snow-gum)–E. ovata (Swamp Gum)–E. viminalis (Manna Gum)–E. rubida (Candlebark) forest

These species once formed widespread open-forests on the moderately fertile soils of the Steiglitz and Ballarat plateaus (Scarlett, pers. comm. 1988). The understorey was grassy, similar to that found on the Dundas Tableland ([Wannon Region](./wannon' }})).

#### Damp/wet sclerophyll forest

_Eucalyptus obliqua_–_ E. radiata_, open- to tall open-forests (10–40 metres high) are very widespread throughout the region. Locally, either species may form pure stands (e.g. _E. obliqua_ in the Wombat State Forest) or several species may occur as co-dominants. For example, in the Mt Cole State Forest _E. rubida_ occurs as a co-dominant on the lower eastern slopes, with _E. globulus_ subsp. _bicostata_ co-dominant in some areas. The understorey of the latter eucalypt characteristically consists of _Acacia dealbata_, _A. melanoxylon_ and _Exocarpos cupressiformis_, with the ground-layer commonly dominated by _Pteridium esculentum_. _Eucalyptus viminalis_ is usually present, and may dominate the wetter sites, particularly along watercourses. Near O’Briens Crossing, on the Lerderderg River, this species dominates a riparian community that has an understorey of _Acacia dealbata_, _A. melanoxylon_, _A. verticillata_, _Bursaria spinosa_, _Cassinia longifolia_, _\*Genista monspessulana_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Hakea sericea_, _Leptospermum lanigerum_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Prostanthera lasianthos_ and _P. rotundifolia_, with the aquatic species _\*Myriophyllum aquaticum_ and _Triglochin procerum_ common in the flowing water. On the drier slopes above the river, the understorey is largely replaced by a ground-layer dominated by _Poa_ spp.

### Fern gullies

Fern-dominated communities are usually small, and very scattered in the wetter gullies of the mountain ranges. This community can be seen at the Ferntree Waterfall picnic area and Richards camping ground, both in the Mt Cole State Forest. The most common tree-fern is _Dicksonia antarctica_. The other ferns that characterize these fern gullies include _Blechnum nudum_, _B. wattsii_, _Cyathea australis_, _Pteridium esculentum_ and _Todea barbara_. The understorey characteristically consists of the species found in the _Eucalyptus obliqua_/_E. radiata_-dominated [wet sclerophyll forest](#damp-wet-sclerophyll-forest). The community is dominated by _E. viminalis_ (up to about 40 metres high), with _E. obliqua_, _E. radiata_ and _E. rubida_ further up the slopes and along the ridges.

### Dry woodlands and forests

The vegetation of this region is commonly modified by changes in aspect. In general, the northern slopes of the Great Dividing Range are much drier than the southern slopes. Frequently, the eastern slopes are drier than the western slopes.

#### Eucalyptus dives (Broad-leaf Peppermint)

This species is widespread and fairly common in low open-forests and woodlands, often on quartz-rich soils. Characteristically it occurs on drier slopes in poor shallow soils (e.g. north-western slopes along O’Briens Road, Lerderderg Gorge). Here, it forms a low woodland (7–8 metres high), with the shrub-layer dominated by _Hakea sericea_ and the ground-layer dominated by _Poa_ spp. A slightly taller woodland, with _Eucalyptus dives_ and _E. macrorhyncha_ co-dominant, occurs in the Pyrenees.

#### Eucalyptus goniocalyx (Long-leaf Box)

This species is widespread and fairly common in dry open-forests and woodlands, often on quartz-rich, poor skeletal soils. The community is similar in structure to that of the _Eucalyptus dives_ alliance. On the lower north-western, northern and north-eastern slopes of Mt Avoca (the Pyrenees), _E. goniocalyx_-dominated low forest/woodland occurs. The shrub-layer is open, and consists of _Bursaria spinosa_, _Ozothamnus obcordatus_ and _Senecio linearifolius_. The ground-layer is dominated by grasses, _\*Briza maxima_, _Danthonia_ spp., _Dianella revoluta_ and _Poa_ spp. _Eucalyptus goniocalyx_/_E. aromaphloia_-dominated woodland occurs on the granite-derived, sandy outwash slopes of Langi Ghiran. In the Ararat–Stawell area _E. goniocalyx_ is associated with _E. leucoxylon_, with _E. macrorhyncha_ often mostly on the hills. The soil is a heavy orange clay, quartz-rich, with coarse sand derived from a conglomerate. The shrub- and ground-layers consist of _Acacia pycnantha_, _Astroloma humifusum_, _Gahnia radula_, _Kunzea ericoides_ and _Ozothamnus obcordatus_. In this area _Eucalyptus leucoxylon_ becomes increasingly dominant on the deeper alluvial soils, with _E. camaldulensis_ and _E. melliodora_. Much of this community (e.g. between Concongella Creek and Great Western) has been cleared for agricultural purposes.

#### Eucalyptus macrorhyncha (Red Stringybark)–E. polyanthemos (Red Box)

This alliance is common on the drier northern slopes of the Great Dividing Range. _Eucalyptus macrorhyncha_ tends to be restricted to the ridges, frequently with _E. tricarpa_ confined to the flatter areas. Both _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. polyanthemos_ often form small pure stands (e.g. _E. macrorhyncha_ in parts of the Meredith State Forest) (Figure 6.15), but usually they occur together as co-dominants (with other species) or individually with other species. For example, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. polyanthemos_ occur with _E. dives_ and _E. nortonii_ south of Beechworth, and with _E. blakelyi_ south-west of Wodonga. North of Beechworth _E. macrorhyncha_/_E. blakelyi_/_Callitris endlicheri_-dominated woodland occurs on auriferous soils. At Mt Pilot _E. blakelyi_, _E. macrorhyncha_, _E. nortonii_ and _Callitris endlicheri_ occur in the skeletal soils on the granitic outcrop. _Eucalyptus tricarpa_ occurs with _E. macrorhyncha_ on the upper eastern slopes of the Brisbane Ranges, and with _E. polyanthemos_ on McLeans Highway, south of Marshalls Road, Brisbane Ranges. In the Chiltern State Park, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. polyanthemos_ co-dominate with _E. sideroxylon._ The shrub-layer is dominated by _Acacia pycnantha, Brachyloma daphnoides, Chrysocephalum semipapposum, Dianella revoluta, Dillwynia phylicoides, Exocarpus cupressiformis, Grevillea alpina, Hibbertia obtusifolia, Hibbertia_ sp. aff. _stricta_ and _Pultenaea foliolosa_ (Plate 6O). The ground-layer is commonly bare over large areas, or is covered with leaf and bark litter, and mosses (e.g. _Campylopus introflexus_, _Hypnum cupressiforme_ var. _tectorum_ and _Triquetrella papillata_).

_Eucalyptus polyanthemos_ frequently occurs as a co-dominant in a mixed forest. Near Lake Nillah-cootie it occurs with _E. cypellocarpa_, _E. goniocalyx_ and _E. radiata_. This area is transitional between the Midlands and the Eastern Highlands Regions. In the Swanpool area the _E. polyanthemos_–_E. melliodora_ alliance grades into a mixed open (partlycleared) woodland dominated by _E. goniocalyx_, _E. macrorhyncha_, _E. polyanthemos_ and _E. camaldulensis_ on the flatter terrain that is transitional between the Midlands and Riverina Regions. Near Beaufort the two species occur with _E. aromaphloia_, _E. melliodora_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. rubida_. _E. dives_, _E. goniocalyx_, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. polyanthemos_ dominate a dry sclerophyll forest that occurs on the skeletal soils of the undulating lowlands and foothills in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne (such as at Eltham).

#### Eucalyptus microcarpa (Grey Box)–E. tricarpa (Red Ironbark)

This alliance is common in areas where the mean average rainfall is less than 635 mm per annum (e.g. near Bendigo, Castlemaine, Maryborough, Rushworth, St Arnaud and Stawell) (Plate 6P). In the Chiltern area _E. tricarpa_ is replaced by the closely related _E. sideroxylon_. _Eucalyptus microcarpa_-dominated open-woodlands occur on shallow soils of the hills and ridges in the Inglewood Flora Reserve (Walsh 1987). The understorey comprises a moderately dense shrub-layer of _Acacia calamifolia_. The ground-layer is rich in herbaceous species (e.g. _Cheilanthes austrotenuifolia_, _Gonocarpus elatus_, _Hypoxis glabella_ and _Wurmbea latifolia_). _Eucalyptus microcarpa_/_E. Tricarpa_/_E. leucoxylon_ open-forests (up to 20 metres high) occur on the flatter terrain, in coarse, often quartz-rich alluvium. The shrub-layer is similar to that found in the [_Eucalyptus viridis_-dominated mallee](#eucalyptus-viridis-green-mallee). On sites with deeper soils (usually on the southern and eastern slopes) a dense shrub-layer develops. The common shrubs include _Correa reflexa_, _Olearia teretifolia_ and _Westringia eremicola_. _Eucalyptus leucoxylon_ is more common along watercourses and sometimes occurs in pure stands. The shrub-layer is very sparse, and the common herbs include _Einadia hastata_, _Hydrocotyle laxiflora_, _Plantago varia_, _Ranunculus pumilio_ and _Stipa elegantissima_ (Walsh 1987).

#### Eucalyptus obliqua (Messmate)–E. macrorhyncha (Red Stringybark)–E. baxteri (Brown Stringy-bark

In the Brisbane Ranges an association of _Eucalyptus obliqua_, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. baxteri_ dominates a low open-forest or woodland, occurring on Tertiary lateritic sandy clay soils. _E. dives_ is often associated with this community, with _E. radiata_ a relatively minor species in the dissected areas on the cooler slopes. The heathy understorey is dominated by _Banksia marginata_, _Grevillea chrysophaea_, _Hakea sericea_ and _Xanthorrhoea australis_. The ground-layer is dominated by _Lepidosperma semiteres_. This community is very similar to the _Eucalyptus baxteri_/_E. obliqua_-dominated dry sclerophyll forest of the Otway Plain.

### Mallee and woodland communities

Four species of mallee occur in this region, each forming distinctive associations within gravelly-sediment mallee (Cheal _&_ Parkes, in Noble _&_ Bradstock 1989).

#### Eucalyptus viridis (Green Mallee)

The _Eucalyptus viridis_ association occurs in the Inglewood and Tarnagulla Flora Reserves. This relatively open association has a structurally and floristically diverse shrub- and ground-layer. The shrub-layer is characterized by _Acacia acinacea_, _A. pycnantha_, _Cassinia arcuata_, _Ozothamnus obcordatus_ and _Pultenaea prostrata_. The sparser ground-layer typically consists of _Bracteantha viscosa_, _Daucus glochidiatus_, _Dianella revoluta_ and _Senecio tenuiforus_. In shallower or skeletal soils, particularly on ridges and crests, _Acacia calamifolia_, _Baeckea behrii_, _Eucalyptus viridis_ and _Melaleuca uncinata_ form a dense, upright shrubland to about 5 metres high (Walsh 1987). The ground-layer is relatively sparse, characteristically with _Brachyscome_ spp., _Glischrocaryon behrii_, _Helipterum (sensu lato)_ spp., _Hibbertia riparia_ and _Thysanotus patersonii_. Walsh (1987) records a variant of this association that lacks or has a reduced _Eucalyptus_ component. This variant occurs on sites of impeded drainage or on the sandy outwash slopes. The species commonly occurring in this variant include _Allocasuarina muelleriana_, _Baeckea crassifolia_, _Calytrix tetragona_, _Dampiera dysantha_ and _Platysace lanceolata_.

#### Eucalyptus polybractea (Blue Mallee)

The _Eucalyptus polybractea_ association occurs mainly on flat areas or depressions between the rises that support _E. viridis_ (Walsh 1987) in the Inglewood and Tarnagulla areas. Frequently _E. behriana_ and _E. viridis_ occur as co-dominants. The shrub- and ground-layers characteristically consist of _Acacia lineata_, _Calytrix tetragona_, _Glischrocaryon behrii_, _Melaleuca decussata_, _M. wilsonii_ and _Phebalium obcordatum_.

#### Eucalyptus behriana (Bull Mallee)

The _Eucalyptus behriana_ association (e.g. at Long Forest Flora Reserve, north-east of Bacchus Marsh) has an understorey dominated by _Melaleuca lanceolata_ and _Rhagodia parabolica_. The large areas between the mallees are commonly bare or covered with leaf and bark litter, _Hypnum cupressiforme_ var. _tectorum_ (a moss), and _Einadia hastata._ However, _Einadia hastata_ is usually more closely allied to adjacent woodland communities than to the mallee communities.

A floristically-rich mallee community occurs to the north of Bendigo on low ironstone-ridges of sedimentary origin, in clayey and gravelly soils. This area is known as the ‘Whipstick mallee’, and is included in the Whipstick and Kamarooka State Parks. The mallee _Eucalyptus_ species are _E. behriana_, _E. froggattii_ (only in the Kamarooka State Park), _E. polybractea_ and _E. viridis_. The shrub-layer consists of several species of _Acacia_ (including _A. williamsonii_, which is restricted to this area), _Dampiera_, _Glischrocaryon_, _Grevillea_, _Melaleuca_ and _Prostanthera_, with the herb-layer consisting of many orchids and annual herbs.

### Heathlands

Although _Leptospermum myrsinoides_ heathland is primarily restricted to the Otway Plain (refer below for further details), it is also present in the Brisbane Ranges of this region. The dominant species include _Aotus ericoides_, _Epacris impressa_, _Hakea sericea_, _Leptospermum myrsinoides_ and _Tetratheca ciliata_.

#### Granite outcrop communities

An open-shrubland (dominated by _Acacia deanei_ subsp. _paucijuga_) to open-heathland (dominated by _Correa glabra_, _Dodonaea viscosa_ subsp. _cuneata_ and _Stypandra glauca_) occurs on the granite out-crops (e.g. Mt Hope, Pyramid Hill and Terrick Terrick). Other common plants include _Cheilanthes austrotenuifolia_, _Clematis microphylla_, _Drosera peltata_, _Isotoma axillaris_, _Lavatera plebeia_ and _Pimelea linifolia_. A few old trees of _Allocasuarina verticillata_ occur at Mt Hope. The common grasses include _Agrostis avenacea_, _Danthonia_ spp. and _Stipa_ spp. In general, these communities are disturbed, and several weedy species are usually present.

## Land use

Most of the region is privately owned, and is used for agriculture, such as sheep and beef-cattle grazing, crop production (wheat, barley and oats), dairying (limited amount) and mixed farming (including pigs and poultry). There are also small areas of fruit orchards (e.g. Harcourt) and vineyards for wine production (e.g. Avoca). _Eucalyptus_ oil is harvested in a few areas (e.g. north of Bendigo, Inglewood, St Arnaud and Wedderburn). _E. polybractea_ is the preferred species because of its high cineole content. Hardwood eucalypts are harvested for firewood, fencing timbers, railway sleepers and sawlogs (Anon. 1978). Softwood plantations of _Pinus radiata_ (e.g. near Creswick) supply timber, veneers and pulp. Many areas, from Stawell (in the west) to Kyneton (in the east), contain gold-bearing sediments. Some of the most productive goldfields in Victoria were worked in this region. The most important fields were Ballarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Dunolly, Inglewood, Stawell and Wedderburn.
