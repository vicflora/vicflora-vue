## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

In Victoria this region consists of four disjunct ‘desert’ Lowan Sands areas. It includes the Little Desert in the south (between latitudes 36°25’S and 36°42’S), the Big Desert (between latitudes 35°15’S and 36°15’S), the southern part of the Sunset Country in the north (between latitudes 34°42’S and 35°5’S), and a small disjunct area in the southern part of the Hattah–Kulkyne National Park, to the east of the Calder Highway (at a similar latitude to the previous area). The first three areas join up in South Australia to form a single unit, with the western boundary formed by the Murray River, the eastern shoreline of Lakes Alexandrina and Albert, and the Coorong. This region incorporates part of the Murray Mallee of Laut et al. (1977a, 1977b).

In New South Wales a disjunct area occurs mainly to the east of the Darling River, from near Lake Mungo (latitude 33°42’S) in the south, to about the 32°30’S meridian of latitude in the north.

For a summary of the information available on this region, refer to Cottington and Harris (1987).

Major grids A–C, F–G. Approximate area 14 575 km<sup>2</sup>.

## Major landforms

The major landform of this region in Victoria is an extensive undulating siliceous sandy plain (Lowan Sands) comprising the Little Desert, Big Desert and Sunset Desert. This irregularly aligned, subparabolic, consolidated dune system is of Pleistocene origin.

The topography of the region is characterized by loosely compacted surface formations, all of which are below 200 metres altitude. A useful summary of the geology and physiology of this region is provided in Anon. (1987), Wasson (in Noble & Bradstock 1989), Gibbons and Rowan (this volume) and Douglas (this volume).

## Climate

The region is characterized by a semi-arid steppe-like climate similar to that experienced by the Murray Mallee Region. For further details refer to the previous region (above), Anon. (1987) and ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

## Vegetation

The vegetation characteristic of this region frequently occurs as complex mosaics with those typical of the Murray Mallee. Therefore the vegetation descriptions provided here should be read in conjunction with those presented for the Murray Mallee Region.

### Mallee communities

For a brief discussion of the mallee habit and an overview of typical mallee communities, refer to the introduction to the vegetation of the [Murray Mallee Region](./murray-mallee)

#### Deep-sand mallee

This community occurs in the loose pale-yellow sands of the parabolic and irregular dunes of the younger Lowan Sand Formation (Anon. 1987). It is common in the southern Sunset Country. The community is dominated by _Eucalyptus costata_. The open shrub-layer is characterized by _Acacia ligulata_ and _Leptospermum coriaceum_. The ground-layer typically supports _Glischrocaryon behrii_, _Triodia scariosa_ and many composites (e.g. _Helichrysum leucopsideum_).

#### Loamy sand mallee

This community occurs on the heavier loamy sands of the Big Desert and Wyperfeld National Park dunefields. The dominant eucalypts are _Eucalyptus costata_ and _E. leptophylla,_ and sometimes _E. socialis._ The open shrub-layer commonly consists of _Bertya mitchellii, Callitris verrucosa, Glischrocaryon behrii, Hibbertia. riparia_ and/or _H. virgata._ Common species of the ground-layer include _Danthonia caespitosa, Senecio glossanthus, S. lautus_ and _S. quadridentatus_

### Mallee–heath communities

#### Mallee–heath

The mallee–heath communities have a high proportion of xeromorphic shrubs, and are intermediate in structure between the mallee shrublands and the heaths. This community commonly occurs on the white sandy dunes of the Lowan Sand in the Big Desert. The dominant eucalypts include _Eucalyptus leptophylla_ and/or _E. costata_. The shrub-layer is typically dominated by _Allocasuarina pusilla_, _Callitris verrucosa_, _Hakea muelleriana_ and _Leptospermum coriaceum_. There is a great diversity of co-dominant shrubs and ground-layer species. These include _Aotus subspinescens_, _Baeckea behrii_, _B. crassifolia_, _Calytrix telragona_, _Comesperma calymega_, _Cryptandra leucophracta_, _C. tomentosa_, _Glischrocaryon behrii_, _Grevillea ilicifolia_, _Hibbertia riparia_, _Leucopogon rufus_, _Melaleuca wilsonii_ (particularly in the Big and Little Desert, and at Lake Hindmarsh in the Murray Mallee Region) and _Spyridium subochreatum_. _Triodia scariosa_ is common. These grasses die in the centre as they slowly grow outwards forming rings and finally, through disintegration, crescents. The centre of these rings are often colonized by other plants. Common monocotyledons of the ground-layer include _Lepidobolus drapetocoleus_, _Lepidosperma carphoides_, _L. viscidum_, _Lomandra collina_, _L. juncea_ and _L. leucocephala_. _Banksia ornata–Xanthorrhoea australis_ shrublands dominate large areas (e.g. in the Little Desert). _Banksia marginata_ and _Leptospermum myrsinoides_ are frequent co-dominants. Mallee–heath and riverine communities from central Wyperfeld National Park are mapped in Figure 6.12.

#### Shallow-sand mallee–heath

Small isolated areas throughout the Big Desert support a community that is intermediate between mallee–heath and loamy sand mallee (Anon. 1987). The dominant eucalypts are _Eucalyptus costata_ and _E. leptophylla_. The shrub-layer includes _Acacia spinescens_, _Brachyloma ericoides_, _Callitris verrucosa_, _Calytrix tetragona_, _Leptospermum coriaceum_ and _Spyridium eriocephalum_. Typical heathland species dominate the ground-layer.

#### Dune-crest tree–heath

_Eucalyptus arenacea_ dominates the overstorey of a community that is restricted to the crest of dunes of the Lowan Sand formation in the Big Desert. _Eucalyptus costata_ is often present. The tall, open, shrub-layer is characterized by _Baeckea behrii_, _Callitris verrucosa_ and _Leptospermum coriaceum_. This community closely resembles the deep-sand mallee community.

#### Broombush mallee

This community is dominated by _Melaleuca uncinata_, with a scattered over-storey of _Eucalyptus costata_ and/or _E. leptophylla_. Common shrubs include _Acacia calamifolia_, _Baeckea behrii_ and _Callitris verrucosa_. The ground flora usually consists of _Baeckea crassifolia_, _Glischrocaryon behrii_, _Hibbertia riparia_ and _Stipa mollis_. This community occurs on loamy swales and broad sand dunes, closely associated with the underlying sandstone. This community is common in the Big Desert, in a band to the west of Pine Plains and Lake Albacutya.

### Woodlands

#### Heath woodland

_Eucalyptus arenacea_ and, occasionally _E. leucoxylon_ subsp. _slephaniae_, form an open (scattered) emergent tree-layer over typical heathland (see below). This community occurs around sandstone outcrops.

#### Yellow Gum woodland

Several small isolated soaks that are scattered throughout the Big Desert and Wyperfeld National Park support this community. Typically, low stunted trees of _Eucalyptus leucoxylon_ subsp. _stephaniae_ occur over an open understorey and ground-layer. Scattered shrubs included _Acacia calamifolia_ and _Dodonaea viscosa_. The ground-layer is dominated by annual herbs, perennial grasses, or by _Lepidosperma viscidum_ (Anon. 1987).

#### Scrub–pine woodland

_Callitris verrucosa_ (Scrub Cypress Pine) may frequent areas of mallee–heath, loamy sand mallee, or sandplain heath. If these areas remain unburnt for extended periods, a low woodland dominated by _Callitris verrucosa_ develops (Anon. 1987). The shrub-and ground-layers are very sparse. The many-branched trees reach a height of about five metres. Since fires occur frequently throughout the region, this community occurs as small isolated and scattered remnants, with the most significant occurrences in the north-eastern parts of the Big Desert and in the Wyperfeld National Park.

#### Pine–Buloke woodland

This community occurs on lunettes associated with creek systems in this region. It is dominated by _Callitris preissii_ (Slender Cypress Pine) and/or _Allocasuarina luehmannii_ (Buloke). The community is more common in the [Murray Mallee Region](./murray-mallee). Refer to the latter region for further details. In this region the community occurs on the Wirrengren Plain along Outlet Creek, just north of the Wyperfeld National Park.

### Heathlands

#### Sandplain heath

The term ‘heath’ or ‘heathland’ refers to the ericoid low shrublands that are characteristically dominated by Epacridaceae, Casuarinaceae, Myrtaceae (particularly _Leptospermum)_, Proteaceae (particularly _Hakea_ and _Banksia_), Rhamnaceae and _Xanthorrhoea_ (Specht 1972). The herbaceous layer is commonly dominated by Cyperaceae and Restionaceae. The soils are usually sandy and have a low fertility.

In this region, the main occurrences of this alliance are in the Big Desert and the Little Desert, where it is characteristically dominated by _Allocasuarina pusilla_, _Banksia ornala_ and _Xanthorrhoea_ species. Other common species include _Acacia_, _Allocasuarina muelleriana_, _Banksia marginata_, _Baeckea_, _Calytrix_, _Correa_, _Cryptandra_, _Hibbertia_, _Hypolaena_, _Lepidobolus_, _Lepidosperma_, _Leptospermum myrsinoides_, _L. coriaceum_, _Leucopogon_ and _Pultenaea_ (Plate 6D). The height of the heath varies from 0.5 metre to about 2 metres.

### Sandstone-rise broombush

A series of NNW–SSE trending ridges underlie the dunefields. These sandy ridges have been lateritized into red sandstones which occasionally outcrop (e.g. Red Bluff, Big Desert). This community is dominated by _Melaleuca uncinata_ and _Baeckea behrii_. _Eucalyptus calycogona_, _E. costata_, _E. dumosa_ or _E. socialis_ are occasionally present. Other shrubs are uncommon, however, _Acacia calamifolia_ and _Cryptandra tomentosa_ are usually present (Plate 6E).

### Tea-tree scrub

_Leptospermum coriaceum_ (Tea-tree) may form a dense scrub 2–3 metres high. A few other shrubs are also present (e.g. _Aotus ericoides_, _Banksia ornata_, _Hibbertia riparia_ or _Micromyrtus ciliata_). The ground-layer is characterized by _Neurachne alopecuroidea_. This community colonizes the sand deposits associated with the Outlet Creek system.

### Floodplain woodlands/open-forests

This community is a minor component of the vegetation of this region. The most significant example of this community occurs on the flood-plains of Outlet Creek in the Wyperfeld National Park (Figure 6.12). The soil is characteristically a grey clayey loam, usually with well-contrasted profile differentiation (essentially duplex in structure). This community is also described for the Murray Mallee and Riverina Regions.

### River Red-gum woodland/forest

Refer to description of this community for [Murray Mallee Region](./murray-mallee).

The example of this community at Outlet Creek, Wyperfeld National Park (Figure 6.12), has been so degraded that the mature trees are dying without regenerating.

### Lake beds

Refer to description of this community for [Murray Mallee Region](./murray-mallee).

## Land use

Parts of this region have been cleared for the cultivation of cereal crops and grazing; however, most attempts at agriculture have been unsuccessful. _Melaleuca uncinata_ is harvested for ‘brush fences’. The National and State Parks ensure the conservation of the remaining native flora and fauna.
