## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

The Otway Range extends from the southern limits of the Tertiary sediments of the Otway Plain (in the north) to the coast in the south. The region includes the Lower Cretaceous sediments of the Otway Group (Anon. 1976; Douglas 1977). The most westerly limit of the region approximates to the 200-metre contour (following the Chapple Vale Fault), including Moonlight Head and a narrow coastal strip to the east of the Gellibrand River mouth. The Gellibrand River valley is excluded from this region (being included in the Otway Plain). The western boundary excludes most of the communities that occur on the coarse Tertiary sands (e.g. heathlands and woodlands with heathy understorey). The eastern boundary of this region follows the western limit of the Moggs Creek catchment, then swings north to just south of Bambra.

## Major landforms

The Otway Range is composed of alluvial and fluviatile non-marine sediments (sandstones and shales) that were laid down in a basin or rift valley during the Lower Cretaceous (Gill 1977). The elevation of these sediments began in the mid-Cretaceous period (Douglas 1977), and resulted in a large elongate dome. The topography is steeply dissected, especially on the northern inland fall and on the southern coastal fall, whereas it is sometimes undulating on the top of the range. The terrain near the coast is often less steep, although massive sand-dunes may also be present (e.g. Quaternary Sands on the western side of Cape Otway) or the steep southern slopes of the Otway Block (Lower Cretaceous) continue to the coast. Tertiary outcrops are also present (e.g. near Cape Otway and near Lorne). The highest point in the region is Mt Cowley (670 metres), with the elevation of the main ridge reaching about 500 metres. A detailed account of the geology of this region is provided by Wopfner and Douglas (1971).

The soils associated with the Lower Cretaceous sediments of the Otway Range are chiefly fertile loams and earths (Gibbons & Rowan, this volume) and in high-rainfall areas (mean annual rainfall 1000–2000 mm) support forests of _Eucalyptus cypellocarpa, E. globulus, E. obliqua_ and _E. regnans._ These soils often occur in deeply-dissected terrain, and landslides, slumping and sheet erosion are common. In areas where the mean annual rainfall is less than 1000 mm, open-forests of _E. globulus, E. obliqua_ and _E. radiata,_ occur. The soils surrounding the Lower Cretaceous sediments are extremely variable, and are generally podzolic (for details refer to Pitt 1977).

The streams tend to radiate out from the central range. The main stream that originates from the northern side of the region is the Gellibrand River. The streams of the southern slopes are generally short and swift-flowing. These include the Barham, Cumberland, Kennett and Wye Rivers.

## Climate

The climatic variation within the region is primarily associated with the topography of the ranges. In general, the climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. In summer, easterly to northerly winds flow over the region, whereas in winter and spring the winds are westerly or south-westerly. These latter air flows are rain-bearing, with the result that the Otway Range experiences frequent and often heavy rain during winter and spring. The main ridge of the Otway Range is the wettest part of the region (mean annual rainfall greater than 1800 mm) (Linforth 1977). The rainfall is very reliable, with the winter rainfall being up to about 2.5 times that of the January falls. The mean temperature maxima are higher inland than on the coast during summer; however, the coast has slightly higher maxima in winter (for details refer to Linforth 1977). Frosts are rare on the coast, and may be very localized inland. Snow occurs at higher elevation two or three days per year (see also ‘Climate of Victoria’, this volume).

## Vegetation

### Forests and woodlands

#### Cool temperate rainforest

_Nothofagus cunninghamii_ (Myrtle Beech), usually with _Acacia melanoxylon_ (Blackwood) as a co-dominant, forms a closed-forest community in wet montane gullies and on moist protected slopes (mean annual rainfall greater than 1280 mm), particularly at high elevations (340–500 metres). _Hedycarya angustifolia_ is the dominant understorey tree or shrub. The shrub- and herb-layers are usually sparse or absent (except _Hedycarya angustifolia_ and _Australina pusilla_, which are both common). Ferns are generally prolific, with the most common ferns being _Asplenium bulbiferum_, _Blechnum chambersii_, _B. wattsii_, _B. fluviatile_, _Cyathea australis_, _Dicksonia antarctica_, _Grammitis billardieri_, _Hymenophyllum australe_, _H. cupressiforme_, _Lastreopsis hispida_, _Microsorum pustulatum_, _Polyphlebium venosum_ and _Polystichum proliferum_ (Plate 6V). These forests are floristically similar to those found at low elevations in other parts of Victoria (Howard & Ashton 1973), with the notable distinction that _Atherosperma moschatum_ is absent. _Eucalyptus regnans_ sometimes forms a sparse overstorey stratum. Earl and Bennett (1986) also recognize an _Acacia melanoxylon_-dominant sub-community of this rainforest that almost totally lacks _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ (e.g. near Egans Track). Common species in this subcommunity include _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Olearia argophylla_, _Pimelea axiflora_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Prostanthera lasianthos_ and _Tasmannia lanceolata_.

Cool temperate rainforest is widespread in the region but has been significantly reduced in abundance since European settlement. These forests are geographically isolated from other rainforests in Victoria, and represent the western extremity of this vegetation type in Australia. Examples of this community occur at the headwaters of the Johanna River (Figure 6.17), Carlisle River, Lardner Creek, Upper Gellibrand River, Skenes Creek and Smythe Creek (Gowans, Yugovic & Myers 1985; Earl & Bennett 1986).

### Wet sclerophyll forest/damp sclerophyll forest

These communities are characterized by open-forest (less than 40 m high) to tall open-forest (exceeding 40 metres high) communities. _Eucalyptus regnans_ (Mountain Ash) is commonly dominant on the wetter sites (mean annual rainfall greater than 1270 mm). This species often forms pure stands at elevations above 488 metres. In the southern parts of the region (e.g. along Cape Otway Lighthouse Road in the Otway State Forest) it commonly forms mixed stands with one or more of _Eucalyptus brookeriana_, _E. cypellocarpa_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. viminalis_. At lower altitudes (122–274 metres), _E. globulus_ is also present (e.g. in the Parker and Kennett River areas (Parsons, Kirkpatrick & Carr 1977). _E. cypellocarpa_ typically occurs in a zone separating _E. globulus_ from _E. regnans_-dominated forest. _E. ovata_ is widespread in the region, and characteristically occurs on poorly-drained sites in valleys and flats. _E. viminalis_ is particularly common along watercourses (e.g. upper Parker River valley), in wet depressions and on floodplains. The most widespread eucalypt in the region is _E. obliqua_. This species occurs on very infertile to fertile soils, from the range to the coast and on wet to dry sites. It commonly associates with _E. globulus_, _E. cypellocarpa_ and _E. regnans_. On even drier sites it occurs with _E. aromaphloia_, _E. baxteri_, _E. willisii_, _E. radiata_ and _E. viminalis_ (in dry sclerophyll forest or woodland communities) (Parsons, Kirkpatrick & Carr 1977). Natural hybrids between _E. regnans_ and _E. obliqua_ (known as ‘Otway Messmate’) are common.

The understorey of the wet sclerophyll forest/damp sclerophyll forest is commonly dominated by _Acacia melanoxylon_, _Bedfordia arborescens_, _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Olearia argophylla_, _Phebalium squameum_, _Pittosporum bicolor_, _Pomaderris aspera_ and _Prostanthera lasianthos_ (Plate 6W). The shrub-and herb-layer is frequently poorly developed (up to 4 metres high, although mostly 2–3 metres), typically with _Acacia stricta_, _A. verniciflua_, _A. verticillata_, _Billardiera longiflora_ (an occasional climber), _Bursaria spinosa_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Lomandra longifolia_, _Olearia lirata_, _O. phlogopappa_, _Pimelea axifora_ and _Viola hederacea_. _Lepidosperma laterale_ frequently dominates the ground-layer, particularly when the shrub-layer is sparse. The fern flora is often abundant, with the most common being _Blechnum wattsii_, _Cyathea australis_, _Dicksonia antarctica_ and _Polystichum proliferum_. Epiphytic ferns, such as _Grammitis billardieri_, _Hymenophyllum cupressiforme_ and _Microsorum pustulatum_, are common in the wetter sites. Opportunistic native species and exotic weeds (such as _Acaena novae-zelandiae_, _Goodenia ovata_, _\*Holcus lanatus_, _\*Hypericum androsaemum_, _Oxalis_ spp., _Ozothamnus ferrugineus_, _\*Prunella vulgaris_, _Pteridium esculentum_, _\*Rubus fruticosus_ spp. agg., _Senecio linearifolius_, _Tetrarrhena juncea_ and _Urtica incisa_) are frequent in the more disturbed sites.

The ground-layer and understorey beneath _Eucalyptus globulus_ varies with rainfall from a grassy ground-layer (e.g. _Poa labillardieri_, _P. sieberiana_ and _Themeda triandra_) (hence forming a grassy forest rather than a wet sclerophyll forest), with or without a sparse shrub-layer of _Acacia stricta_ and _Ozothamnus ferrugineus_, to a denser shrub-layer of _Acacia mucronata_ and/or _A. verticillata_ and _Pultenaea daphnoides_. _Leptospermum continentale_ and/or _Melaleuca squarrosa_ often form dense thickets under _Eucalyptus ovata_.

Wet sclerophyll forests and damp sclerophyll forests are widespread throughout the region, ranging from riparian to montane environments. They predominantly occur in high-rainfall areas on the slopes of the Otway Range and in moist lowland situations on Cretaceous sediments of moderate–high nutrient status (Earl & Bennett 1986). Taller forests occur at higher altitudes, in high-rainfall areas.

#### Dry sclerophyll forest/woodland

_Eucalyptus baxteri_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. radiata_ co-dominate to form an open-forest to woodland at low elevations (140–240 metres), or _E. obliqua_ dominates the other species (together with _E. ovata_) to form an open-forest (altitude 120–170 metres) throughout much of the lower Gellibrand River valley (e.g. Carlisle River and Lardner Creek areas, Earl & Bennett 1986). These forests and woodlands occur on Tertiary sediments of low-nutrient status and moderate rainfall. This community is more common in the neighbouring Otway Plain Region to the north and north-west. The understorey of the former alliance is composed of several heathland species (e.g. _Banksia marginata_, _Leptospermum continentale_, _Lomandra longifolia_ and _Tetratheca ciliata_), whereas the latter alliance is characterized by _Acacia mucronata_, _Leptospermum continentale_ and _Ozothamnus ferrugineus_. The amount of disturbance in the latter alliance is significant, and is expressed by a high frequency of opportunistic native species in the shrub- and herb-layer (e.g. _Ozothamnus ferrugineus_, _Pteridium esculentum_ and _Tetrarrhena juncea_). _Platylobium formosum_ is often also present.

Woodlands dominated by _Eucalyptus pryoriana_ occur on the dune crests and in some of the interdune corridors to the north-east of the Cape Otway lighthouse. Other species that form woodland communities include _E. kitsoniana, E. willisii, E. ovata_ and _E. pauciflora_ (for further details refer to Parsons, Kirkpatrick & Carr 1977).

_E. tricarpa_-dominated dry sclerophyll forest occurs on exposed dry sites (mean annual rainfall 690–840 mm) near Aireys Inlet (Kirkpatrick 1970). This community is more common in the neighbouring Otway Plain.

### Heathlands and shrublands

_Leptospermum myrsinoides_ (Silky Tea-tree) heathland is primarily restricted to the Gellibrand River valley of the Otway Plain to the north and north-west of the Range (see description under the Otway Plain Region).

Inland heathlands occur predominantly in the Carlisle and Gellibrand River valley areas of the Otway Plain (mean annual rainfall 1090 mm). The following brief description of this community is included here because the generalized nature of the western boundary incorporates some of this community in the Otway Range. This closed community is dominated by a number of sclerophyllous shrubs and herbs, including _Acacia suaveolens_ (usually on better-drained soils), _Empodisma minus_, _Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus_, _Leptospermum continentale_ and _Melaleuca squarrosa_. Other common species include _Bauera rubioides_, _Gahnia sieberiana_ and _Sprengelia incarnata_. This community is restricted to depressions and areas of impeded drainage on coarse sandy Tertiary sediments. A similar community occurs near the coast in the Blanket Bay area (mean annual rainfall 860 mm) and near Marengo (mean annual rainfall 1120 mm), both to the east of Cape Otway. Many of the coastal heathlands from Cape Otway to Lorne are dominated by _Leucopogon parviflorus_. These heathlands are usually dense and are 1–1.5 metres high. Other common shrubs include _Acacia sophorae_, _A. verticillata_, _Acrotriche affinis_, _Alyxia buxifolia_, _Correa alba_, _Leptospermum laevigatum_ (up to 3 metres high), _L. scoparium_, _Lomandra longifolia_, _Olearia axillaris_, _Ozothamnus turbinatus_ and _Rhagodia candolleana_. _Allocasuarina verticillata_ (about 4 metres high) is usually scattered throughout the community. _Leucophyta brownii_ is common on steep, exposed coastal cliffs, usually with _Leucopogon parviflorus_. _Isolepis nodosa_, _Lepidosperma gladiatum_ and _Poa labillardieri_ are scattered, but may be common, particularly in more open areas.

Earl and Bennett (1986) recognized a riparian scrub association that is associated with streams and wet depressions. _Melaleuca squarrosa_ and _Leptospermum continentale_ dominate a closed shrub-layer in an open-forest of _Eucalyptus baxteri_ or _E. obliqua_ at higher altitudes (220metres). This community occurs in the Carlisle area, Gellibrand River valley (both Otway Plain Region) and the Otway National Park.

### Saltmarsh and non-saline swamps

The low-lying estuarine flats of the Aire River support a community of _Juncus kraussii_, _Phragmites australis_, _Schoenoplectus pungens_ and _S. validus_ (Parsons, Kirkpatrick & Carr 1977).

Non-saline swamps are usually dominated by _Melaleuca squarrosa_ and _Leptospermum lanigerum_.

## Land use

Utilization of the hardwood forests for timber and pulp (for paper and hardboard) has a long history in the region (Anon. 1976). Extensive _Pinus radiata_ plantations occur in the region (e.g. near Beech Forest). The major agricultural industries include dairying, beef-cattle grazing and potato growing. Large areas of forest are presently reserved for water supply management.
