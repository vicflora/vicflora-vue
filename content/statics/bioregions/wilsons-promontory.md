## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

This region is the most southerly part of mainland Australia. The north-western and northern boundary includes the Darby River (west coast) and the south-west corner of Corner Inlet. The remaining promontory to the south of this boundary constitutes the region. The low, sandy, Yanakie Isthmus that connects this southern, granitic mountainous mass to the mainland is excluded from the region, even though it is part of the current National Park. The islands included in this region are Doboy (Doughboy), Benison and Granite (in Corner Inlet); Shellback (west coast), Rabbit, and the Seal Group (east coast), and all islands north of Rodondo and the Hogan Group.

Major grid T. Approximate area 410 km<sup>2</sup>.

## Major landforms

Wilsons Promontory is composed entirely of early Devonian granitic bedrock, with superficial and localized deposits of Quaternary sediments (particularly sands and peats) (Brownlie & Brownlie 1973, p. 15; Wallis 1980). The granites are the northern limits of a formation extending to north-eastern and eastern Tasmania. The topography is dominated by the exposed and weathered, rugged granitic mountains and hills. Water and wind erosion along fault lines and joints has resulted in valleys (such as Lilly Pilly Gully) and rounded tors (particularly evident along the Boulder Range). The highest point is Mt Latrobe at 754 metres. The Quaternary deposits occupy relatively small areas of the Promontory. They are composed of yellow calcareous sands (to the west of the Promontory), white siliceous sands (mainly to the east, e.g. the beaches at Oberon and Waterloo Bays, with Squeaky Beach on the west coast an exception), calcarenites (cliffs at Darby Bay and extending to Shellback Island), and peats (e.g. in the Darby River area). The present beaches have resulted from recent and current sand deposition. Alluvial and swamp deposits have also formed from the deposition of weathered granite mountains and hills. Swampy areas occur in the low-lying area north of Mt Vereker and inland of coastal dunes behind most beaches (e.g. Sealers Cove and Tidal River).

## Climate

Wilsons Promontory experiences a comparatively mild climate with moderate temperatures characteristic of a maritime environment. The mean maximum temperatures at Tidal River range from 24°C in February to 13°C in July. The mean minima range from 13°C in February to 6°C in August (Ashton & Webb 1977). Frosts are rare. Precipitation is generally reliable with the maximum rainfall occurring during winter (mean annual rainfall about 1090 mm). The precipitation above 300 metres is often enhanced by low cloud and mist. Snowfalls are rare on Mt Latrobe. Typical of other exposed coastal areas, this region experiences strong winds that are mainly westerlies and fluctuate from north-west to south-west. See also ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

## Vegetation

The vegetation of this region and that of the nearby Gippsland Highlands are very similar. The more mountainous parts of both regions have forests of _Eucalyptus baxteri_, _E. globulus_, _E. regnans_ and _Nothofagus cunninghamii_, as well as fern gullies.

### Forests

Tall forests, probably of _Eucalyptus baxteri_, _E. globulus_, _E. muelleriana_ and _E. regnans_, with highly developed fern gullies, would have covered the slopes in the past (Willis in Anon. 1969). However, only remnants of these mountain forests and fern gullies remain. The bush-fires of this century have been so intense and frequent that these tall forests will probably never regenerate. Tall forests (including large trees of _E. globulus)_ once occurred at Pillar Point (Garnet 1971). Today, this area is reduced to a salt-pruned, stunted woodland (see below). The more heavily timbered parts of the region occurred mainly on the eastern (leeward) side of the mountains (e.g. on the eastern slopes of the ranges to the west of Sealers Cove). On the lower eastern slopes (near Sealers Cove) large logs are all that remain of a tall forest (Garnet 1971). Audas in Ewart (1910) observed trees of _Eucalyptus muelleriana_ (incorrectly referred to as _E. pilularis)_ about 200 feet (60 metres) high at Sealers Cove. Other large trees that he listed from this area were _E. globulus_, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. viminalis_. A _Leptospermum continentale_–_Kunzea ambigua_ heathland now occurs in this area. _Eucalyptus macrorhyncha_ (Audas in Ewart 1910) and _E. sieberi_ (Willis in Anon. 1969) once grew near Sealers Cove, but have not been recorded since 1909. Large areas support populations of _E. obliqua_ introgressed with _E. regnans_ (Otway Messmate) (Ashton, pers. comm. 1988).

#### Cool temperate rainforest

Cool temperate rainforest occurs at Sealers Cove, Refuge Cove (both of the east coast), Mt Latrobe (Figure 6.21), Mt Ramsay and Fraser Creek (which flows into Oberon Bay on the west coast). The *Nothofagus cunninghamii-*dominated closed-forest consists of only a few species forming a canopy of 8 to about 42 metres. Tall _Acacia melanoxylon_ (often not common), _Atherosperma moschatum_ and _Pomaderris aspera_ occur as co-dominants or as understorey trees, together with _Pittosporum bicolor_. Common understorey shrubs include _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Olearia lirata_, _O. phlogopappa_ and _Tasmannia lanceolata_. A tree-fern association frequently develops in many of the shady gullies. Characteristically, these fern gullies are dominated by _Cyathea australis_, _Dicksonia antarctica_ and _Todea barbara_, often with some _Cyathea cunninghamii_. The ground-layer is characteristically composed of a rich fern flora (e.g. _Asplenium bulbiferum_, _A. flabellifolium_, _Blechnum fluviatile_, _B. wattsii_, _B. patersonii_, _Ctenopteris heterophylla_, _Grammitis billardieri_, _Microsorum pustulatum_, _M. scandens_ and _Polyphlebium venosum_), together with _Gahnia clarkei_ (Howard & Ashton 1973; Howard & Hope 1970). On the sheltered aspects of the summit of Mt Latrobe occurs a low closed-forest of _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ (3–4 metres high) in humus-rich soils. The associated shrubs include _Callistemon pallidus_, _Epacris impressa_, _Monotoca elliptica_, _Olearia stellulata_ and _Tasmannia lanceolata_. The herb-layer consists of _Blechnum wattsii_, _Dianella tasmanica_, _Gahnia sieberiana_ and _Libertia pulchella_, plus numerous bryophytes and lichens. However, much of the summit of Mt Latrobe is strewn with stumps, and fallen and burnt trunks of _Nothofagus cunninghamii_, plus _Eucalyptus obliqua_. These are closely associated with the exposed, grooved tors. Ashton and Webb (1977) suggest that it is likely that before the fires of this century, the boulders of this mountain top were largely clothed with humus-rich moss mats, thick enough and moist enough to sustain tree roots for long periods. The presence of the _E. obliqua_ stumps suggests that this species formed an overstorey to the rainforest. An interesting wind-sheared _Nothofagus_ heathland (1 metre high) occurs amongst the rocks on exposed western slopes of this mountain. The associated shrubs and herbs are similar to those found in the _N. cunninghamii_ low closed-forest (see above).

#### Warm temperate rainforest

The depauperate form of warm temperate rainforests dominated by _Acmena smithii_ on Wilsons Promontory represent the most southerly extension in Australia of this tropical element (Ashton & Frankenberg 1976). The only other tropical representative is the tree species _Elaeocarpus reticulatus_ which extends to Tasmania. The structure of these forests is relatively simple, with the dense canopy reaching 20–27 metres on well-drained sites. On wetter sites the understorey is often composed of suppressed seedlings and saplings of _Acmena smithii._ Common understorey species include _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Pittosporum bicolor_, _Olearia argophylla_, _Cyathea australis_, _Dicksonia antarctica_ and _Todea barbara_—the latter three tree-ferns are particularly common in many of the shady gullies and watercourses. _Lepidosperma elatius_ is very common, and forms large, tall communities in the fern gully at Sealers Cove (Garnet 1971). On drier sites, the understorey is usually poorly developed, except in gaps in the canopy, and the floor of the forest may be covered solely with litter. _Australina pusilla_, _Gahnia clarkei_, _Polystichum proliferum_ and _Tetrarrhena juncea_ are confined to these gaps. _Clematis aristata_, _C. glycinoides_ and _Parsonsia brownii_ are common lianes. An overstorey of emergent _Acacia melanoxylon_ and _Eucalyptus obliqua_ (most common), _E. muelleriana_ or _E. globulus_ (on better-drained sites) and _E. ovata_ (on poorly-drained sites) is present. The ground-layer is dominated by ferns (e.g. _Blechnum nudum_, _B. wattsii_, _Microsorum pustulatum_ and _M. scandens_), including the filmy ferns _Hymenophyllum australe_, _H. cupressiforme_, _H. flabellatum_, _Macroglena caudata_ and _Polyphlebium venosum_.

This community mostly occurs along the streams and flats radiating from the Mt Latrobe–Mt Ramsay massif, and the foothills of the Vereker Range. Particular sites include China-mans Creek (Figure 6.22), Darby River, Lilly Pilly Gully and Sealers Cove.

#### Eucalyptus obliqua-dominated wet sclerophyll forest

_Eucalyptus obliqua_ is the dominant species on the cooler sites, particularly above elevations of 500 metres. The understorey of these tall open-forests is dominated by wet sclerophyll forest shrubs such as _Pomaderris aspera_ and _Zieria arborescens_. The original forest of _Eucalyptus obliqua_ has largely been decimated on Mt Ramsay and has been replaced by a shrubland of _Olearia stellulata_ and _Epacris impressa_ (Ashton & Webb 1977).

#### Eucalyptus obliqua/E. baxteri-dominated dry sclerophyll forest

A low open-forest (4–6 metres high), dominated by _Eucalyptus obliqua,_ occurs on drier sites than those of the previous community. This community often has _E. baxteri_ as a co-dominant, although, characteristically, the latter species tends to occur in the drier areas (e.g. North Tidal Overlook). A low open-forest dominated by _E. baxteri_ occurs on deep gravelly outwash soils of the lower westerly slopes of Mt Bishop.

### Woodlands

#### Banksia integrifolia

_Banksia integrifolia_ and _B. serrata_ occur either occasionally in the _Leptospermum laevigatum_ thickets (e.g. at Tidal River) (Figure 6.23) or in small woodlands (up to 12 metres high) on calcareous sands (e.g. near Darby River). The ground-layer species include _Dichondra repens_, _Isolepis marginata_, _Pteridium esculentum_ and other herbaceous species (particularly orchids).

#### Eucalyptus baxteri

This species forms an association between some heathlands and the drier sclerophyll forests, on siliceous sands or gradational and duplex soils. _Eucalyptus baxteri_ occurs as a stunted form in low shrubby thickets (up to 2 metres high) or as low trees. _E. willisii_ and _Allocasuarina verticillata_ occur occasionally throughout the upperstorey of these woodlands (particularly in shallow soils near granite outcrops). Common understorey species include _Acacia suaveolens_, _Allocasuarina paludosa_, _Amperea xiphoclada_, _Banksia marginata_, _B. spinulosa_, _Billardiera scandens_, _Correa reflexa_, _Gonocarpus tetragynus_, _Hakea sericea_, _Kunzea ambigua_, _Lepidosperma laterale_, _Leptospermum continentale_, _Lomandra filiformis_, _Spyridium parvifolium_ and _Xanthorrhoea australis_. The richer (less sandy) soils support taller woodlands, with the trees 10–18 metres high. Although _Eucalyptus baxteri_ usually dominates this formation, _E. obliqua_ and _E. willisii_ may also be present as co-dominants. A mixed, stunted _E. baxteri_–_E. obliqua_–_E. willisii_ woodland occurs on the granite-derived soils of Pillar Point (north of Tidal River).

### Heathlands and thickets

#### Allocasuarina pusilla–Leptospermum myrsinoides heathlands

These two species form low (about a metre high) dense heathlands on the siliceous parabolic dunes and deeper sand sheets (e.g. at Tidal River) (Figure 6.23). It is the most widespread association that occurs on moderately well-drained sites. This association is often replaced by _Eucalyptus baxteri_ woodland and then _Melaleuca squarrosa_ thickets on sites with increasingly poor drainage (Parsons 1966, pl. 37, fig. 3). Other species that commonly occur in this association are _Banksia marginata_, _Epacris impressa_, _Hakea sericea_, _Hypolaena fastigata_, _Isopogon ceratophyllus_, _Leucopogon ericoides_, _L. virgatus_, _Lomandra filiformis_ and _Xanthorrhoea australis_ (Plate 6d).

_Eucalyptus baxteri_ frequently occurs as emergent shrubs at mid-dense to open densities, forming a community which is structurally intermediate between the heathland and the [_E. baxteri_-dominated woodland](#eucalyptus-baxteri).

#### Leptospermum laevigatum thicket

Thickets of _Leptospermum laevigatum_ occur on calcareous sands (e.g. at Tidal River) (Figure 6.23) behind the current beaches (Costermans 1981; Parsons 1966). The main species associated with this formation is _Leucopogon parviflorus_, usually occurring as a tall shrub or an undershrub. The thickets are up to about 8 metres high. Parsons (1966) records the following understorey species: _Acaena_ sp., _Clematis microphylla_, _Correa alba_, _Dichondra repens_, _Geranium potentilloides_, _Lepidosperma glacliatum_, _Lomandra longifolia_, _Muehlenbeckia adpressa_, _Poa_ sp., _Senecio glomeratus_, _Solanum aviculare_, _Swainsona lessertiifolia_ and _Viola hederacea_. Scattered occurrences of _Allocasuarina verticillata_ also occur in this community.

_Leptospermum laevigatum_ also occurs on the siliceous parallel sand dunes and on the exposed north-western granitic slopes of Mt Oberon. The thickets on Mt Oberon are lower and more open than those on the dunes. This latter association grades into [_Eucalyptus baxteri_ low-woodland](#eucalyptus-baxteri).

#### Melaleuca ericifolia thicket

Thickets of _Melaleuca ericifolia_ occur on soils ranging from peaty sands to amorphous peats (Parsons 1966). At Tidal River (Figure 6.23), they are found inland from the saltmarsh and attain a height of about 8 metres. In the more saline conditions, the understorey is predominantly of saltmarsh species (e.g. _Samolus repens_, _Sarcocornia quinqueflora_ and _Selliera radicans_). Further inland, scattered tall shrubs of _Acacia verticillata_ and understorey species of _Gahnia_, _Goodenia ovata_ and _Poa_ spp. dominate the thicket. In drier sites _Melaleuca squarrosa_ replaces _M. ericifolia_.

#### Melaleuca squarrosa thicket

This association is the most widespread of the swamp communities. It occurs adjacent to _Melaleuca ericifolia_ thickets on the better-drained sites, in peaty sands to amorphous peats (Figure 6.23). The thickets are usually about 4 metres high, with scattered plants of _Acacia verticillata_ and _Ozothamnus ferrugineus_. The understorey is dominated by _Gahnia_ spp. Other common understorey species include _Bauera rubioides_, _Billardiera scandens_, _Empodisma minus_, _Gleichenia microphylla_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Gonocarpus tetragynus_, _Leptospermum continentale_, _Leucopogon australis_, _Phragmites australis_ and _Pultenaea stricta_. On fibrous peats _Melaleuca squarrosa_ forms a lower (up to 2 metres high), more open formation (the _Melaleuca squarrosa_ heath association of Parsons 1966). The understorey comprises several sedges (e.g. _Cladium procerum_, _Gahnia_ spp., _Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus_ and _Lepidosperma forsythii_).

#### Granite outcrop heathlands

The granitic outcrops on the spurs and summits of Wilsons Promontory are characterized by _Kunzea ambigua_ (at elevations below 400–500 metres) and _Callistemon pallidus_ (above about 300 metres). These two sclerophyllous shrubs occur in the shallow soils surrounding the rock outcrops. The herb-layer is dominated by bryophytes, lichens, annuals and geophytes. In the salt-affected coastal fringe, _Carpobrotus rossii_, _Disphyma crassifolium_ subsp. _clavellatum_ and a succulent form of _Senecio lautus_ are common in the shallow soils (Plate 6e). In more sheltered areas of _Allocasuarina_–_Leptospermum_ heathland (see above), _Kunzea ambigua_-dominated heathland is usually present as an intermediate zone around the granite outcrops. These rock-heaths also occur in _Eucalyptus baxteri_ forests/ woodlands and _E. obliqua_ forests above elevations of 300 metres. _Callistemon pallidus_ rock-heaths occur on the southern aspects of Mt Oberon, associated with _Leptospermum continentale_.

### Saltwater communities

#### Juncus kraussii–Samolus repens-dominated saltmarsh

Saltmarsh communities occur on undifferentiated sands and sandy peats (e.g. Tidal River). The formation is dominated by _Juncus kraussii_, _Samolus repens_, and locally often by _Sarcocornia quinqueflora_ and _Stipa stipoides_, with _Selliera radicans_ and _Gahnia filum_ as common associates. Small halophytic communities (including _Atriplex_ spp., _Disphyma crassifolium_ subsp. _clavellatum_ and _Rhagodia candolleana_) occur in the crevices of elevated rock platforms along the west coast (e.g. near Picnic Point), on the offshore islands (see below), in some tidal estuaries (e.g. Tidal River) and along the shores of Corner Inlet. Other species that occur scattered throughout these salty areas include _Correa alba_, _Leucophyta brownii_ and _Poa poiformis_ (e.g. at Tongue Point) (Plate 6e).

#### Mangrove

The muddy coastline in Corner Basin (Corner Inlet) supports a saltmarsh with some fringing mangroves of _Avicennia marina_. (For further details on this community refer to the description for the [Gippsland Plain](./gippsland-plain#mangrove'.))

### Granite islands

All the Promontory islands are granitic (Gillham 1961; Norman 1971; Wallis 1980). The vegetation of these islands is usually a low tussock-grassland or low shrubby thicket.

#### Poa poiformis-dominated closed-tussock-grassland

The tussock community is usually monospecific. Occasionally, _Alyxia buxifolia_, _Apium prostratum_, _Bulbine bulbosa_ and _Correa alba_ occur in sheltered crevices within this association (Dannevig Island—Norman, Brown & Deerson 1980). Other occasional associates include _Disphyma crassifolium_ subsp. _clavellatum_, _Leptospermum laevigatum_, _Lobelia alata_, _Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum_, _Senecio lautus_ and _\*Sonchus oleraceus_ (Citadel Island—Norman & Brown 1979) or _\*Hypochoeris radicata_ and _Pelargonium australe_ (Hope & Thompson 1971).

#### Leptospermum laevigatum thicket

This species forms a mixed shrubby association on most of the islands. Frequently the association forms several disjunct communities (e.g. Wattle Islands—Norman, Brown & Deerson 1980). This association is usually extremely dense, often 2–3 metres high, commonly with _Correa alba_ and _\*Paraserianthes lophantha_.

#### Disphyma crassifolium subsp. clavellatum-dominated halophytic herbfield

This association forms a distinctive, low closed sward on most islands. It forms a dense community when established in soil, but when established in crevices the community is more open, with the plants extending across the sloping rock-face (Norman & Brown 1979; Norman, Brown & Deerson 1980). A few species are sometimes associated with this community (e.g _\*Hypochoeris radicata_, _Lobelia alata_ and _\*Sonchus oleraceus_—on Cliffy Island). Small areas of _Sarcocornia quinqueflora_ often occur in exposed westerly areas (Hope & Thompson 1971).
