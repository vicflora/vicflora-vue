## Location

<bioregion-map-component :regions="regions"></bioregion-map-component>

This region extends down from the higher-altitude Snowfields below 900—1300 metres to an elevation of about 200 metres (adjacent to the Midland Region in the north and the Gippsland Plain in the south). The wet sclerophyll forests below the _Eucalyptus delegatensis_ community are included in this region. However, it was not possible to circumscribe this region accurately by a generalized and simplified boundary. The highly dissected and rugged landscape results in the development of an extremely complex mosaic of floristic communities. The western limit of this region is geologically (and floristically) defined by the position of the eastern limits of the Newer Volcanic basalt plain (of the Victorian Volcanic Plain). These two regions adjoin at Kilmore East and just north of Yan Yean (between longitudes of approximately 145°00’ and 145°05’E). In the north-east this region is continuous with the Southern Tablelands (of New South Wales), whereas, in the south-east it is juxtaposed with [East Gippsland](./east-gippsland) (refer to the latter region for a description of their common boundary).

## Major landforms

The basic physiographic structure of the Eastern Highlands is best considered in conjunction with that of the Snowfields Region as the important formative geological events are common to both regions. The two regions are characterized by the uplifted and dissected remains of ancient erosion surfaces. Mountains composed chiefly of volcanic rocks (e.g. the Baw Baw and Buffalo Plateaus, the Strathbogie Ranges and upper catchments of the Yarra, Latrobe and Goulburn Rivers) are the result of exposure and continued erosion of intrusions formed during the Devonian period. The majority of the Eastern Highlands and Snowfields Regions are, however, the result of more recent (Tertiary) uplift and subsequent deep dissection of Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous sediments. Small areas of basalt exist but these are largely confined to the Snowfields Region as cappings on some of the higher mountains (see also Douglas, this volume).

The soils of the region are complex. Typically, shallow soils occur on ridges and on steep upper slopes. However, fertile loams and earths are typical of much of the higher-rainfall mountains (Gibbons and Rowan, this volume). A typical profile has a thick and loose litter layer overlying a dark-brown friable loam with strongly developed fine structure. With increasing depth, the colour initially becomes paler, then usually more reddish or stronger brown, and textures change to clay loam or light clay (Anon. 1973a). Very fertile loams are associated with basalt (particularly in the Silvan–Wandin area).

## Climate

Topographic variation results in the climate varying greatly within this region. In general, the amount of rainfall increases and the temperature decreases with increasing elevation. This region is one of the highest rainfall areas of Victoria (ranging from about 770 to at least 1500 mm per annum). The region experiences a temperate climate, with warm, dry summers (January or February being the driest months, with 40–90 mm per month) and cool to cold winters (May to July usually being the wettest months, with 150–180 mm per month). Only the highest and wettest plateaus receive more than 50 mm per month in summer. In general, the rain-bearing winds are westerlies, north-westerlies and south-westerlies. Topographically-induced rainshadow areas occur on the leeward (eastern) side of mountain ranges. Light snowfalls occur fairly regularly during winter above elevations of about 750 metres (e.g. Mt Cudgewa, Mt Donna Buang, and Mt Strathbogie). The summer mean maximum temperatures can be quite high (about 22–30°C) and winter mean maxima vary from 7°C to 28°C. Minimum temperatures can vary greatly, and are influenced by topography (e.g. aspect, depressions and valleys). The summer mean minimum temperatures vary from 7°C to 16°C and winter mean minima vary from –1°C to 4.5°C. See also ‘Climate of Victoria’ (this volume).

## Vegetation

### Cool temperate rainforest

Closed-forest occurs as disjunct communities throughout the southern central highlands of this region. The community is dominated by one to three species of trees to a height of about 42 metres. _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ is the dominant species of the community in this region. _Atherosperma moschatum_ is subdominant (rarely exceeding 23 metres in height) to _Nothofagus cunninghamii_ or _Acacia melanoxylon_. _Acacia dealbata_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Hedycarya angustifolia_, _Pittosporum bicolor_ and _Tasmannia lanceolata_ are common shrubs to small trees. Lianes are rare or absent. The moist to wet, protected gullies of the cool temperate rainforest support a species-rich fern flora. For example, Gullan and Walsh (1986) record thirty-four fern species from cool temperate rainforest in the Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges (also see Gullan et al. 1979). Of the ferns, _Blechnum_ spp. (e.g. _B. fluviatile_, _B. nudum_, _B. wattsii_) and _Dicksonia antarctica_ dominate the understorey. _Cyathea australis_ and _Polystichum proliferum_ are also common. The filmy ferns, _Hymenophyllum cupressiforme_ and _Polyphlebium venosum_ are also abundant. Several epiphytic ferns are common (e.g. _Asplenium bulbiferum_ and _Microsorum pustulatum_). Bryophytes and lichens are common on tree-trunks, fallen logs and rocks (Howard & Ashton 1973, table 1).

On the Australian mainland, the principal areas of cool temperate rainforest are found only in [East Gippsland](./east-gippsland), the [Gippsland Highlands](./gippsland-highlands), [Wilsons Promontory](./wilsons-promontory), the [Otway Range](./otway-range) and in this region. The last four regions support rainforests dominated by _Nothofagus cunninghamii_, whereas this species is absent from East Gippsland. The distribution of cool temperate rainforest within Victoria is given by Seddon and Cameron (1985a, and 1985b). Busby (1987) proposes that the former distribution of this community was more extensive than is now observed, but that recolonization after glaciation has been prevented by recurrent fires. Also, the opportunity for recolonization is reduced in _Nothofagus_ because the capacity for this genus to disperse (seeds dispersed by gravity) is less relative to that of _Atherosperma_ (seeds wind-dispersed).

Cool temperate rainforest chiefly occurs along wet montane rivers and gullies, and more rarely on sheltered mountain slopes and plateaus. In this region, it can be found at the following scenic reserves: Mt Donna Buang (Figure 6.18), Cement Creek, Mt Victoria, Myrtle Gully, and Cumberland (all localities are near Melbourne).

### Wet forests

Tall open-forests dominated by _Eucalyptus regnans_ are widely distributed throughout much of the region below elevations of 1300 metres (more commonly below about 950 metres). _Eucalyptus delegatensis_ (mostly associated with vegetation of the Snowfields Region) forms tall open-forests (montane forests) above elevations of about 950 metres. Similar forests are occasionally dominated by _Eucalyptus nitens_. The understorey (up to about 7 metres high) is dominated by shrubs, with the ground-layer consisting of ferns, grasses and herbs. Ashton (in Groves 1981) provides a general overview of the tall open-forests in Australia.

#### Eucalyptus regnans forests

_Eucalyptus regnans_ (Mountain Ash) occurs mostly as pure stands, but may occur in association with other eucalypts (such as _E. cypellocarpa_, _E. nitens_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. viminalis_. _Eucalyptus regnans_ frequently forms natural hybrids with _E. obliqua_ (Ashton 1981), and occasionally with _E. macrorhyncha_ (Ashton & Sandiford 1988). These forest are very tall with _E. regnans_ (the world’s tallest flowering plant) reaching heights of 40–95 metres; however, many of the tallest representatives have now lost their tops (e.g. ‘Valley of the Kings’, near Cumberland Falls). The understorey is characteristically three-layered. Tall shrubs and small trees dominate the upper stratum up to 30 metres high (e.g. _Acacia dealbata_, _Bedfordia arborescens_ and _Pomaderris aspera_), the middle stratum consists of smaller shrubs (e.g. _Cassinia aculeata_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Correa lawrenciana_, _Olearia argophylla_, _Pittosporum bicolor_) and the tree-ferns (_Dicksonia antarctica_ and _Cyathea australis_), usually 3–15 metres high, and the lower stratum (ground-layer) consists of ferns, sedges, wire-grass and herbs (e.g. _Histiopteris incisa_, _Lepidosperma elatius_, _Pimelea axiflora_, _Polystichum proliferum_, _Pteridium esculentum_, _Tetrarrhena juncea_ and _Viola hederacea_. On the drier sites (e.g. northern slopes) _Cassinia aculeata_ often forms an open but continuous shrub stratum (particularly soon after fire). Other shrubs that tend to become more prevalent in the later stages of regeneration may also be present (e.g. _Olearia argophylla_, _O. lirata_ and _Prostanthera lasianthos_). The wetter sites usually support a denser and taller shrub-layer. _Pomaderris aspera_ often forms a dense shrub stratum, interspersed with _Cassinia aculeata_, on wetter sites in the early stages of regeneration after fire. The understorey species soon increase in diversity. In general, the understorey becomes more dominated by ferns with age from the last fire (Ashton 1976) (Figure 6.19). However, the drier sites usually have a ground-layer that is dominated by _Pteridium esculentum_ and _Tetrarrhena juncea_ (Plate 6X). In the Toolangi, Powelltown and Toorongo districts, considerable areas of former _Eucalyptus regnans_ forest have reverted to closed-forest of various _Acacia_ spp. or scrub in which _Cassinia aculeata_, _Dodonaea_, and _Pteridium esculentum_ are common. This is the result of repeated wildfires (Anon. 1973b; Gill, this volume).

Most of the Victorian _Eucalyptus regnans_ forests are more or less even-aged (Figure 6.19). This has arisen following the destruction of seed-bearing trees by severe bushfires (Ashton 1976). This community is predominantly confined to the southern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, being common and widespread in the Acheron Valley and the Black Range, and on the Cerberean and Kinglake plateaus, and in the Dandenongs to Walhalla area. The lower limit of this community is at about 450 metres on the sheltered southern escarpments. Other occurrences are in the headwaters of the Bunyip, Latrobe, Thomson, and Yarra Rivers (Gullan et al. 1979). Characteristically it occurs on deep, friable brownish gradational soils; however, at lower elevations it occurs in reddish gradational soils derived from igneous parent rocks.

### Damp forests

_Eucalyptus obliqua_ and _E. cypellocarpa_-dominated open-forest (up to 40 metres high) is common throughout much of the region. _Eucalyptus baxteri_, _E. dives_, _E. radiata_ and _E. sieberi_ are often associated with this community. The understorey varies considerably but is usually a dense shrub-layer (e.g. _Acacia mucronata_, _Cassinia aculeata_ and _Daviesia ulicifolia_) up to 3 metres high. The common sub-shrubs and ground-layer species include _Billardiera scandens_, _Blechnum cartilagineum_, _Calochlaena dubia_, _Epacris impressa_, _Gonocarpus tetragynus_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Lepidosperma laterale_, _Lindsaea linearis_, _Lomandra filiformis_, _Platylobium formosum_, _Poa_ spp., _Pteridium esculentum_, _Spyridium parvifolium_, _Stylidium graminifolium_, _Tetratheca ciliata_, _Tetrarrhena juncea_ and _Viola hederacea_.

_Eucalyptus radiata_ forms an open-forest (28–40 metres high) at elevations of 300–1100 metres (rainfall of more than 1020 mm per annum) (Anon. 1972c, 1973a, 1974b). On cool moist sites it is frequently associated with _Eucalyptus globulus_ or _E. viminalis_, and on drier sites it associates with _E. dives_, _E. macrorhyncha_ and _E. mannifera_. The understorey often consists of scattered small trees or shrubs (e.g. _Acacia dealbata_, _A. melanoxylon_, _Daviesia latifolia_ and _Platylobium formosum_). _Pteridium esculentum_ and _Poa_ spp. are common in the ground-layer. This alliance is common throughout much of the region (e.g. in the Darbyshire–Cravensville area—to the east of Tallangatta, in the Strathbogie Ranges, in the Mansfield area and on the Black Range).

_Eucalyptus dives_ forms a shorter open-forest (15–28 metres high) on shallower, well-drained soils in usually drier areas (rainfall less than 890 mm or over 1140 mm per annum) than those that support the previous alliance. This species either forms pure stands or is associated with _E. globulus_ or _E. rubida_. The understorey and ground-layer is similar to that of the _E. radiata_ alliance. In moist areas, where the tree canopy reaches 25–28 metres in height, the understorey consists of scattered _Acacia dealbata_ and _Cassinia aculeata_, usually with a _Poa_ spp. and _Pteridium esculentum_ ground-layer. The _Eucalyptus dives_ alliance is common throughout much of the region, particularly on northern slopes and ridges (e.g. the area near the upper reaches of the Broken River, north-east of Mansfield).

### Dry forests

Open-forest to woodland (up to 25 metres high), dominated by _Eucalyptus goniocalyx_, _E. macrorhyncha_, _E. polyanthemos_, _E. obliqua_ and _E. radiata_, occurs on the relatively dry, undulating areas below elevations of about 400 metres. The understorey of sparse shrubs (up to 3 metres high) is dominated by _Acacia mucronata_, _A. myrtifolia_, _Cassinia aculeata_ and _Exocarpos cupressiformis_. The sub-shrub- and ground-layer is usually dense. Common species include _Gonocarpus tetragynus_, _Hypericum gramineum_, _Lindsaea linearis_, _Lomandra filiformis_, _Poa_ spp., _Pteridium esculentum_, _Tetrarrhena juncea_, _Themeda triandra_ and _Viola hederacea_. Other species that are usually present include _Acacia stricta_, _Acrotriche serrulata_, _Adiantum aethiopicum_, _Clematis aristata_, _Dianella revoluta_, _Pimelea humilis_, _Microlaena stipoides_ and _Oxalis_ spp. This community occurs on clay-loam soils to the east of the Dandenong Ranges.

_Eucalyptus goniocalyx_ and _E. macrorhyncha_ dominate an open-forest (15–28 metres high) that is common to the south of Corryong (e.g. near Nariel Creek) and to the north of Mt Samaria (east of Lima South). It is also common in the neighbouring Midlands Region, in the Mt Granya area. This alliance is reduced to a low open-forest (usually less than 15 metres high) on drier sites (e.g. the Mt Mitta Mitta and Pine Mountain areas). In these forests _E. dives_ usually grows 18–25 metres high. It either forms pure stands or is associated with _E. goniocalyx_ or _E. macrorhyncha_ (on dry ridges). The ground-layer is grassy with scattered sub-shrubs and herbs dominating (e.g. _Burchardia umbellata_, _Daviesia ulicifolia_, _D. leptophylla_, _Grevillea alpina_, _Lomandra longifolia_, _Platylobium formosum_, _Stackhousia monogyna_ and _Tetratheca ciliata_) (Anon. 1973a).

#### Callitris endlicheri-dominated low open-forest

Low open-forests (less than 15 metres high) dominated by _Callitris endlicheri_ occur on the granite massifs of Pine Mountain and Burrowa. Associated species are typical of a dry sclerophyll forest (e.g. _Eucalyptus blakelyi_, _E. goniocalyx_ and _E. macrorhyncha_). _Brachychiton populneus_ occurs occasionally as a co-dominant. Heathy shrubs (e.g. _Calytrix tetragona_) occur on shallow skeletal soils amongst the exposed rocks. This community also occurs in the neighbouring [Midlands](./midlands) (e.g. Mt Pilot, Mt Porcupine).

#### Eucalyptus rubida/E. pauciflora-dominated low open-forest

A low open-forest usually less than 15 metres high, with _Eucalytus rubida_ and _E. pauciflora_ dominant, occurs along mountain ridges at elevations of 1160–1200 metres (e.g. at Mt Burrowa and east of Cravensville). _E. dives_ is associated with this community on dry rocky sites (Anon. 1972c). The understorey is dominated by low shrubs (e.g. _Bossiaea foliosa_, _Daviesia latifolia_, _Oxylobium ellipticum_ and _Platylobium formosum_). The ground-layer is characteristically dominated by _Poa_ spp. (e.g. _P. sieberiana_).

### Riparian forest

An open-forest occurs on the wet slopes and river banks of most of the major rivers in the region. Gullan et al. (1979) recognize this as riparian forest, however, the distinction from wet sclerophyll forest is not clear. This community is often dominated by _Eucalyptus viminalis_ and sometimes by _E. obliqua_. Understorey species commonly include _Acacia dealbata_, _A. melanoxylon_, _Cassinia aculeata_, _Coprosma quadrifida_, _Cyathea australis_, _Dicksonia antarctica_, _Goodenia ovata_, _Kunzea ericoides_, _Lomatia fraseri_, _Pomaderris aspera_, _Prostanthera lasianthos_, _Rubus parvifolius_ and _\*Rubus fruticosus_ spp. agg. The ground-layer is dominated by _Acaena novae-zelandiae_, _Australina pusilla_, _Blechnum nudum_, _B. wattsii_, _Carex appressa_, _\*Centaurium tenuiflorum_, _Centella cordifolia_, _Gratiola peruviana_, _Hydrocotyle hirta_, _Isolepis inundata_, _Lepidosperma elatius_, _L. laterale_, _Oxalis_ spp., _Poa_ spp., _Polystichum proliferum_, _\*Prunella vulgaris_, _Pteridium esculentum_ and _Viola hederacea_. The liane _Clematis aristata_ and the scrambling plant _Tetrarrhena juncea_ are also common in this community. Examples of this association can be seen on the Acheron, Taggerty, Thomson and upper Yarra Rivers (Gullan et al. 1979) (Plate 6Y).

## Land uses

Hardwood forests cover most of the public land in the region. These forest have been utilized for timber products since the earliest days of European settlement. Most of the common dominant eucalypts have been used as a hardwood resource. _Pinus radiata_ plantations occur on private and public land (e.g. at Lake Eildon, near Kinglake, in the Acheron valley, near Stanley, and in the Ovens valley). Agricultural activities include animal production (e.g. beef, mutton, and wool) and plant production (e.g. tobacco, hops, vegetables, fruits and cut flowers). Orchards (e.g. apples, pears, plums, cherries and strawberries) and market gardens are common to the east of the Dandenong Ranges (e.g. near Silvan) (Anon. 1973b). Catchments south of the Great Dividing Range have been extensively used as Melbourne’s domestic water supply. North of the Divide, surface water has been used for irrigation (e.g. Lake Eildon). Much of the region is used for recreation such as bushwalking and canoeing.
